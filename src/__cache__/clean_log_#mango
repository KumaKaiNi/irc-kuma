I should have done this in screen so that it's just running derp 
well I can't use all my data downloading it 
so I'll grab it in a minute 
>not using tmux 
its just 200MB or something though WizBright 
and bo1g is on windows huehue 
I am the best. 
meaning I'm looking into tmux right now 
dont think I even installed screen on this because systemd services are kickass 
yeah, using screen to daemonize stuff is awful 
worst thing ever 
lel screen 
;-; 
>Using GNU anywhere 
:^) 
I love me some guhnoo 
Then again I'm still stuck with glibc so what can I say 
b r b 
thwack

you're a kid now 
you're a squid now 
fuckin wii u in a box in Utah 
I'm dying for that game too 
so it's ok. 
wii u exploit inc too 
mighht be some piracy inccccc 
but i dunno 
doubt its worth skipping smash online 
I used homebrew to play SNES games etc 
yeah but that's vWii 
there is a real wii u exploit soon 
then I borrowed games from friends and ripped them 
some just didn't work tho 
i wish i had a job 
then i'd buy more harddrives 
have a real internet connection too 
lol 
get a job! 
i'm trying omg 
I have a job :^) 
its hard as fuck 
you die if you work 
i can't even get to the job most ofo the time :| 
do you have tomte on snap? 
I die every day 
no 
he like parties all the time ;~; 
swedish student life 
impossible to find an appartment too ,_; 
rip 
thats the hardest part tbh 
just payed my rent 
sucks 
I wish I made enough to live on my own （ ´_ゝ`） 
I'd take all the qts home 
My daki collection would grow 
gross 
i've applied for like 
10+ appartments now maybe 
oh yeah I guess I bought figs that I wouldnt have bought at home 
guess thats good for something 
though 
i'd probably miss the forest life a bit 
looking out my window, i see a big lake 
:o 
where would your bun bun go ;~; 
I would miss that too 
WizBright, depends 
that's endgoal life for me 
1 room appartment? i couldn't take care of him 
2 room? i'd probably take h im then 
i'm still allergic to hay so it would be kinda problematic 
;~: 
i don't think i have shit to do for the whole summern ow though 
sux 
i have my moms wedding i guess 
but that's not fun 
She is getting remarried? 
well her and my dad never got married 
marriage isn't that common in sweden 
so its her first marriage hue 
wait 
I thought your parents were divorced 
marriages are just shackles imo 
duh 
she got a new MAN m8 
like 8 years ago 
lol 
lol 
lol 
i dunno 
wedding seems pointless 
we don't even have a lot of money 
Whose gonna walk you down the aisle for it :^) 
but she gets pissed every time i mention it 
i'll sit 
in my room 
whole summer 
and git gud at C 
probably going to die from the heat 
sounds fun to me 
imo 
already had like 5 nosebleeds from the dry heat 
i'm going to DIE 
>.> 
i bet its like 2x hotter in usa though 
rip 
hueuhe 
yeah it sucks 
80F walking home today 
humid af 
.wa 80F to celcius 
WHAT 
Liseda: Result: 26.67 °C (degrees Celsius). Additional conversions: 299.82 K (kelvins)|539.67 °R (degrees Rankine)|21.333 °Ré (degrees Réaumur)|21.5 °Rø (degrees Rømer).

oh 
yeah that's p bad 
lol 
nvm 
its the same temp here 
right now 
lol 
its 26 in my room now too 
nice.. 
is sweden melting from that :V 
turn on a fan 
i had to move my computer 
to the floor lol 
cozy 72F in my studio uwu 
because my room got up to 28c 
I think the upstairs is 76-78 ;~; 
creating a wayland compositor/wm would be kinda fun 
#BasementLyfe 
that sounds awful what 
what do YOU know 
mr.windows 
I know when something is AWFUL! 
My gentoomen library is still going lol 
Luminarys: I feel like I am raping your NAS 
o-oh 
bo1g, get your desktop pls 
and become gnooooooo/leeeenuuuuuxxx 
someday 
might be faster to just move back home 
either way I'll get it in September 
either in Maryland or Utah 
truest of mysteries. 
they both sound like redneck names 
am i correct 
maryland is east coast 
utah is mormonville 
sounds scary 
it is 
but it's also dry there 
i guess that's why you like lolis then 
and we have a bus system that isn't trash, despite being more expensive 
and I can afford things there 
wow~ 
for whatever reason milk and potato chips are expensive here 
printer ink too 
not that I have a printer 
i wonder if you could get 
w3m to work in windows 
i'm going to attempt it 
huehue 
so for photoshop 
I make a script to run it in a wineprefix? 
yeah 
export WINEARCH=win32 
export WINEPREFIX="$WINEDIR/.winephotoshop" 
wine "$WINEDIR/.winephotoshop/PhotoshopPortable/PhotoshopPortable.exe" 
is how mine looks like 
lol 
How much have you DLd WizBright? 
I'm on security 
Also you'd be screwing my connection if anything, NAS can handle stuff fine 
How many GBs DLd tho 
idk ┐(￣ー￣)┌ 
lol 
Dude, du 
hahaaha 
how can you not know 
^ 
Time to git gud 
But seriously, du is so basic man 
do you only use a gui file manager or what WizBright 
How have you not looked this up before or used it >.> 
That would explain the plebery :^) 
I would say over 10 maybe? 
idk 
I just use df -h 
I never really look at directory sizes 
>.> 
hahaha 
Why would you not check for individual file sizes for stuff 
At least you know df though 
I don't care about how big stuff is :^) 
:^| 
(^: 
krita is a p cool graphic application 
it has shitloads of KDE dependencies though D: 
used windows in a vm for 10 mins 
headache 
turned it off 
rip 
:> 
lol 
I have to use VMs to play my hentai games >.> 
sure is nice 
not having 
your problems 
uwu 
lol 
i can get some to work with wine 
but its usually some absurd requirements 
like quicktime player and shit lol 
Not worth it is the thing 
japanese devs are the worst 
VM it just werks 
i have a XP VM for that 
most are in unity and opengl now anyway 
And there's no real issues because the games are rarely computationally intensive 
not really too hard 
lol no 
bo1g, that's like 
only illusion? 
They're all written with weird ass engines 
:D 
oh 
all the doujin groups sitll use weird stuff 
Hmm 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
So I have it extracted lis 
I made the script 
what does it say 
I move the files into .winephotoshop? 
no.. 
create your own prefix 
don't follow my script 
you don't even have $WINEDIR 
that's my own personal env that i made 
lol 
;~; 
time 2 git gud 
Does not meet minimal requirements 
(Windows Vista) 
you need to have the windows version set to win7 or higher 
winecfg doesn't even want to run for me （ ´_ゝ`） 
.. 
what are you even doing lol 
how hard can it be to export 2 envs and run winecfg 
export WINEARCH=win32 
export WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.winephotoshop" 
winecfg 
it's not letting me 
whatever fuck it 
? 
well 
a reasonable way would be pasting what it says 
if you literally can't open winecfg for some reason 
then your wineshit is fucked 
yep 
easy fix though 
what did you use? 
some dumb respin of arch right? 
you just don't have the 32bit libraries lol 
lol 
pacaur -S lib32-mpg123 lib32-libxml2 lib32-lcms2 lib32-giflib lib32-libpng lib32-gnutls 
should be enough 
I have tried to run winecfg by setting WINEARCH=win64 
uhh pacman -S 
it still hates me so 
well, reinstall wine then? 
I'll restart and try again 
clear out the variables 
no need to restart though 
printenv 
lol 
I get the same exception after reinstalling.. 
you have multilib enabled right? 
for wine? 
idk 
no.. the repo 
its in /etc/pacman.conf 
[multilib] 
Include = /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist 
should be commented, just uncomment it 
then obviously, pacman -Syu after 
Oh I should have that then 
NIGHT 
eh it still doesn't want to work 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
lol 
i don't see how it cant work with a fresh installation 
must be your antergos poop 
^ 
This is why you do things yourself lol 
like, does antergos use the arch repo or what 
how can wine not run when being installed 
I think they use some stuff from Arch, some stuff from their own 
Oh my god I'm reading the Antergos Developers list 
"Aidan collier is a student at LASA high school in Austin, TX who likes to consider himself a renaissance man, pulling ideas and interests from a variety of places." 
40keks 
>Implying high schoolers actually know jack shit 
>who likes to consider himself a renaissance man, 
hahahaha 
I literally laughed at this 
why not just 
build a good installer for arch lol 
what's the point of making a seperate distro 
Because Evolution or whatever already exists 
These people have no respect for the Arch philosphy 
Opinions discarded 
So I should sudo pacman -Rs wine 
then redo t? 
well 
if it doesnt run then i don't knwo what you can do 
the error messages hints on dependencies missing but 
oh well 
did you 
how about you try this 
compile wine-staging by yourself 
that wil force you to have all the libs required for make 
gcc-multilib and gcc are in conflict. Remove gcc? [y/N] 
this could be an issue right? 
;~; 
Use clang, not GCC 
But yea it's not an issue 
WizBright, no 
just do it 
i did lol 
: wine-staging and wine are in conflict (bin32-wine). Remove wine? [y/N] 
lol 
my life sucks 
well it seems it's true 
wine hates me 
well yeah? 
whyu wouldnt it conflict each other 
whoa 
it actually opened this time 
it shows the winecfg 
it just doesn't show the photoshop.exe 
;~; 
..well 
launch it manually? 
why are you trying to launch photoshop.exe 
you launch PhotoshopPortable.exe 
.. 
HOLY FUCK 
IT WORKED 
well duh 
stop launchg stuff wrong 
Ayyy 
Luminarys: ^ 
WizBright: https://u.teknik.io/TVqo3e.png 
i want a pi 
or something similar 
just for FUN 
NO FUN ALLOWED 
ooh 
unreal engine finally gets it shit to linux 
WizBright: Now that I'm home I realize that my interwebs is taking a hit >.> 
Can you rate limit your DL a bit? 
lol 
rip 
I mean it's not terrible 
It's just I'm actually getting a few milliseconds of latency trying to load webpages >.> 
Fuck I can't play my gaymes 
800+ ping 
This is le problemerino 
Sorry WizBright >.> 
lol 
inb4 it breaks the download 
Well whatever he DLd he has 
But I turned off Apache 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
I cried 
Luminarys: 
baka 
lol 
learn to download stuff properly 
you suck 
nno u 
Downloaded: 2368 files, 20G in 22h 39m 37s (262 KB/s) 
not bad 
wow!! 
lol 
sup 
wow ignoring me 
YEAH 
i'm not doing anything lol 
lol 
I should get more sleep after I download most of it 
oh yeah 
i installed Debian GNU/Hurd 
lol 
wut 
you moved away from arch? 
say it ain't so Liseda 
Luminarys: I didn't get any of the programming books so 
oh well 
I'll go through what I have later and hopeful salvage something 
ofc i didn't 
it was on a vm 
Lol 
Good! 
will probably go the gentoo route when i upgrade in a year or two 
Nice 
Really Liseda? 
I meam what use do you have for Gentoo? 
gotta have tha MemeOS 
Gotta be le meme 
lel 
Luminarys: I am still sad 
I didn't get all the programming books （ ´_ゝ`） 
Hmm, I can rehosterino 
Since I'm out of house 
but 
Actually the best thing to do is an rsync 
how will it make sure to start where it left off? 
That's why I said best thing is to do an rsync >.> 
:o 
Teach me oh wise Luminarys-kun 
I think that rsync initiates connection over SSH 
But I don't know for certain 
Yea you'll want to send me your pubkey 
Or A pubkey 
Probably the one for the server I'm going to rsync from 
or do I need to make a key for it? 
If your user on that server doesn't have a pubkey 
Than yea make it 
time to troubleshoot 
damn keygen hates me 
why does linux hate me 
?? 
This is bretty easy dude 
like ssh-keygen -t RSA -b 4096 
I know 
doesn't allow me to save the key in .ssh 
though 
probably something to do with the perms （ ´_ゝ`） 
Errr 
lel 
there we go 
I fixed it (*￣▽￣*) 
Anyways, paste your pubkey 
Okey dokey you should be good 
As far as rsyncing goes 
rsync -a wiz@rt.luminarys.com:/media/500g/files/Gentoomen\ Library/ </path/to/incomplete library/> 
rsync: link_stat "/media/500g/files/Gentoomen" failed: No such file or directory (2) 
I think that's on your end 
Err 
did you include the escape? 
Or did you just try doing ..../files/Gentoomen Library/ 
has to be ..../files/Gentoomen\ Library/ 
If this gets annoying I'll just rename it though >.> 
rsync -a wiz@rt.luminarys.com:/media/500g/files/Gentoomen\ Library/ /home/wiz/files.luminarys.com 
~1 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
First off 
Well 
Does that fail? 
If it does I'll renamerino 
It does 
that was the error above there 
Right ok 
try with a - 
Gentoomen-Library 
and also 
make sure files.luminarys.com holds the contents of the gentoomen library 
i.e. make sure there is no directory called Gentoomen\ Library within files.luminarys.com 
If there is then change the arg so that it matches 
e.g. /home/wiz/files.luminarys.com/Gentoomen\ Library 
Helloooo~ 
:^) 
hi~ 
wat 
Nice Genera 
Liseda: Mei-mei is helping me with a mango 
And this isn't as active so :S 
what manga 
I'm guessing it's working Luminarys, but it's not outputting anything :o 
and what are you doing? cleaning? 
Cleaning 
and 
WizBright gulps 
Typesetting? 
typesetting ;~; 
WizBright: is it hanging 
Well rather 
is the terminal you ran teh command from just paused 
If so then it's working 
Lol I can typeset if you hate typesetting 
rsync probably own't say anything unless run verbosely 
Yeah it's pasued it looks like 
yea then it's fine 
Mei-mei: I don't want to work you to death 
tbh 
WizBright should do 99% 
he's too lazy 
I know 
Only thing I can't do is TL 
Nah its fine I'm already worked to death 
no 
A little more dead doesn't hurt 
Can you redraw? 
Idk how well I can do that 
Hell yeah I redraw my best point right there 
lol rsync kills the server 
lol wut? 
did it die? 
No it was a joke 
but this is definitely chomping more bandwith than before 
don't do that to me ;~; 
nom nom nom 
Can you like rate limit your DL or something 
lol how 
It's on gigabit connection m8 
--bwlimit=200 
cancel command 
rerun with that arg plz 
Also it's easy to rate limit connections with proper setup lol 
lol 
is that better? 
thanks man （ ´_ゝ`） 
WizBright brings me pain ;_; 
does it kill the man? 
WizBright Abuse Channel | MangoTerm Dev Channel | https://github.com/wizbright/MangoTerm | #rice Genera | Happy Project v4 Scanlation 
shit 
Come on man fix that Genera 
lmfao 
Why does it still say #rice Genera 
Oh wait 
Yea there we go 
my jimmies are no longer ruffled 
why ruffled 
aren't they rustled 
Fuck 
do you have circa 1800s jimmies? 
Ok thx for rate limit 
Server is actually useable 
Don't kill the connection like last time please ;~; 
also hopefully with rsync I won't get all the html indexes 
Why 
rsync easily resumes 
That's the idea 
yea you won't 
mokay 
isn't it just easier 
to try to find a stable torrent instead 
>all the trackers for it are dead 
Yea but there's only one torrent 
And it's ded 
How far along are you guys on your mango project? Sounds exciting 
well 
It's on me now :') 
I got WizBright started 
you mean the mangoterm right? 
Mhm 
But I dunno if he's actually done anything >.> 
I edited the readme and commented the code :^) 
I'll eventually do something with it 
Like it should be pretty easy to extend m8 
I should really schedule out my time 
thanks Luminarys （ ´_ゝ`） 
Functionality wise at least 
UI I have no clue 
I have a lot to do （ ´_ゝ`） 
Not my cup of tea 
Do you have a job? 
i'll make a rival mangoterm 
I do have a job 
fork fork fork fork 
inb4 Liseda makes futaterm 
So productive 
well, i have nothing to do until like the 27th WizBright lol 
;_; 
:3 
I have too much to do 
Full time job programming 
Then I get home and spend the next 3 hours programming 
where are you working lol 
Then I play like an hour or two of vidya with friends 
I guess it's a summer job? 
Ya though it's probably gonna go into school year part time 
I dunno how familiar you are with the area 
local company? 
Ya biotech startup 
It's near Danforth Center 
is it out near boeing? 
the most important thing though, is it -fun-? 
lol 
Yea pretty much Liseda 
If it wasn't fun I wouldn't do it >.> 
Though it's painful as with much of programming 
hey, you never know 
money is money 
i'd do a lot of things that aren't fun for money 
At least we have jobs :^) 
( ≖‿≖) 
yeah 
I'm in HS, so I can pick 
;_; 
Well I can be picky 
i don't know that feeling 
I could pick up a monitor soon 
I mean I would do it if it wasn't totally fun 
<- failure liseda with no future 
But I woudln't do it if it was actually pianful 
rip 
And I hated it 
Liseda: move to the city so you can work and school 
But I kind of intrinsically like most programming 
So it's hard for that to happen 
WizBright, i'm trying 
kinda hard to move without money though lol 
#LisedaHelpFund 
i have enough money for a rent or two atm though 
Have any friends you can room with? 
all my friends are studentnerds already living close to school 
:^( 
i wouldn't mind studying again i guess 
In HS with a job at a biotech company? Geez please lend me whatever you've got 
Luminarys will host our scans :^) 
I'm pretty bad at life Mei-mei 
lol pls 
Host our scans? I can host it... 
looks like a bright future Luminarys 
Your future is just luminating I swear 
It was a joke lol 
Maybe I should hang with Luminarys and start to glow :3 
Pshhhhh bad joke 
Well it's not terrible, but I feel pretty shitty 
Becuase it could be better if I hadn't been so lazy the past 2 years 
oh Luminarys I feel you ;~; 
"lazy" "HS" 
lol 
jesus 
making me feel bad here PFFF 
Shmeh youre still young, life is just starting 
Be lazy while you still can 
Yea but then how do I get into a good college >.> 
I dunno how important undergrad really is tho 
Just write a whole bunch of crap about how motivated you are trust me 
It's not that important really 
Mostly interested in networking tbh 
Luminarys: where you gonna go 
And how much you struggled but persevered...!! 
I have no idea 
you could be my kouhai if you go to SIUe ;) 
Senior next year lel 
wut 
I thought you were a senior.. 
:^| 
lol 
I feel even worse now Liseda 
he's a junior in highschool （ ´_ゝ`） 
I wanna be your senpai come to UC Berkeley :D 
its ok 
Probably not worse than me >.> 
i've had that feeling my whole life 
Yea I'm applying Mei-mei 
you get used to it WizBright!!!! 
The problem is 
The more I learn 
the more I realize I still have to learn 
such is life 
And the more I realize how much I suck at everything 
WizBright pats Luminarys wisely 
Feels pretty bad 
( ´Д｀)ﾉ(´･ω･`) 
It'll be okay Luminarys 
You're not 18 right? 
so we can't go hookah on delmar 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
No WizBright, I don't do drugz :^) 
It's just really smooth tobacco 
you nip 
:3 
It's pretty funny though how many of my peers vaped 
>Goes to PE locker room 
>People vaping everywhere 
is it the new hip thing huh 
It's pretty hilarious tbh 
smoking/vaping is poop 
i'm ~straight edge~ 
Seeing kids blowing smoke rings and such 
actually i'm probably a total sugar junkie 
I only eat dark chocolate >.> 
dark chocolate is the best 
I can't take milk chocolate at all 
i can't take anyhting with substantial amounts of sugar in it either 
Thankfully I can still OD on salt with ramen no issues :^) 
but ramen is so blandddddddd 
Yea that's why they pump salt into it 
Only way to actually give it flavor 
Still tastes bretty gud tho 
yeah salt is nice 
Like salt really does make stuff taste better 
So long as it isn't too concentrated 
Lissy likes her Coke :3 
we could start putting MSG into stuff again :V 
lol 
MSG is delicious >.> 
too much of anything is bad tho 
Sure 
it's a salt 
So you should treat it as such 
well 
time to go get my paycheck 
hopefully I'll have enough to buy the cards I need 
Gotta get them mtg cardz? 
ya 
gimme ur cards m8 :^) 
It's really silly how the good cards are expensive >.> 
:3 
I'll buy them most likely lol 
anyways bbl 
lel k 
Might get Panda Express too (ﾉ)´∀｀(ヾ)﻿ 
( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ 
WizBright, how much do you spend on mgt 
mtg* 
Goddam fake chinese food 
Stupid amounts I'd imagine 
Even has a middle schooler playing mtg 
I spent stupid amounts 
lol 
Though stupid for a middle schooler is probably something like 200ish $ 
i've met some mtg people irl 
the game seems to compilcated 2 me tbh 
too* 
The sad part is that I spent about the same amount of money on Hearthstone in HS 
lol what 
damn 
I didn't learn my lesson >.> 
Actually the real problem is 
All my friends in HS 
i really hate RNG though lol 
We just play vidya together 
i'm a competitive wuss 
So if you don't have the vidya, then no socialization happenz 
So you have to buy the vidya and the IAPs and the god knows what 
Yea hearthstone is lots of rng 
I got salty after getting 1 win away from Legend rank 3 times in a row 
And quiterino 
After that I started working on my meme-tier open source projects and spent more time gitting gud 
So in the end it worked out well enough 
It's just I rarely talked to any of my friends for like a few months during that period 
>.> 
lol 
its kinda fun though 
do you run it in wine? 
I have to choose the life as a neckbeard shutin or a vidya addict 
It's no fun 
i meant the game itself omg 
Yea I ran it in wine 
It was fun 
But then I got salty 
And fed up 
lol 
Also the community is so lel 
i only play some dota these days like 4 games a week 
goddam Twitch Chat 
Is it just as cancerous across the whole site? 
I would assume so 
dunno 
don't like esport or streaming 
rather play the game myself lol 
Twitch is basically just /b/ without the nudes 
The thing is 
lol 
If you're actually interested in gitting gud at the game 
Watching pros is really useful 
well you can't really expect "discussion" with like 50k people anyway 
Yea but it rarely gets even close to that size 
Basically chat is the typical copy pasta 
lol 
A bunch of emote spam 
a league stream has 140k viewers now :S 
And general racism/sexism reactionary b8 
lol 
yeah but 
It's pretty funny at first, but then I just got fedup and never really looked at the chat again 
that's just edgy kids trying to be edgy 
Yea pmuch 
speaking of games 
:^) 
lellel 
Now they're trying to get people to play some game 
to get more games 
i like the steam game 
collecting games. 
more fun than playing games 
? 
the goal is to buy as much cheap games you can on sales 
optional mission: never play it for extra bonus points 
i think i'm doing p well 
Oh yea 
I have like 75 games in my lib 
I've only played 10 really 
So many random indie games and stuff 
i have 289 apparently 
only 104 that works on leeeeeenux 
I'd say 40 of mine are linux 
SteamOS :^) 
47/75 
wow.. it should say SteamOS + GNU/Linux 
GNU/SteamOS :^) 
is this steam chat now? 
lol 
don't change the topic again pls 
I won't （ ´_ゝ`）

WizBright, you never said what manga it was 
Happy Project v4 Scanlation 
i guess happy project is the manga then 
yes 
and Luminarys 
it was in a VM lol 
but seriously didn't see any problems with it tbh 
Like functionality wise 
wouldn't be able to use it as my main OS though 
because i rely on non-free stuff 
Lacks compat for stuff I assume 
Yea 
B-but freedum 
would be cool to use though 
but i don't see how it would work hardware wise 
maybe if i bought one of those coreboot compatible lapttops lol

what happened to mei-mei 
She probably doesn't use a bouncer 
Also lel the leddit discussion finally came to AB 
the fatehate? 
down with FATE 
fate stay night? more like fate stay POOP 
Posted Yesterday, 13:33. 
it happened yesterday Luminarys 
Wasn't paying any attentionerino 
Don't go on the AB forums too much tbh 
me neither 
I usually checkout the creative workshop to see if anything is new 
vultr has restarted my vps twice within the same week 
nice 
yeah 
kinda weird 
whatever gets me out of bed 
I had to have mine restarted because I was moved to a different dc 
well they send me an email stating "our monitoring system has detected a problem and restarted the node etc" 
stop downloading all that futa porn 
>bo1g 
>futa 
lol 
he's a dumb lolicon 
yeah loli ty 
pls 
ew 
but I had to clean up some services because nginx wasnt starting properly and I fixed that 
and hopefully murmur 
so I dont have to wake up and do things 
everything else seemed fine 
bitlbee forgot everything I ever did 
so that was cool 
yeah i dunno 
vultr is cheap 
but if they keep restarting that sounds troublesome 
they restarted my vps too 
tbh if my services work on startup it's not too big of an issue 
but yea it's weird 
if it happens again I'll probably open a ticket 
kinda weird that they block email or what you said 
just by default 
they opened it afterwards 
thats something else I need to fix that I forgot about lol 
I only used that to get another kancolle account so w/e 
not that important 
lol 
WizBright, did you cill my h@h 
I don't have your info to update it 
want your login? 
wat 
you had to update it? 
did the session ran out or what 
yes 
it said the version was too old lol 
gonna make sum mac n cheese 
lol 
Liseda: did you see the new minimal theme for zsh 
it's perfect 
I just need to make it blue now and I'll be good 
which on 
e 
"new minimal theme" 
wat 
lol 
but 
thats just 
removing everything other than the prompt itself 
:^) 
yeah 
user and host rmeoved! 
ya 
it looks pretty 
i like seeing that tho 
for my home connection eh 
I still have your theme somewhere 
ayy Luminarys 
got any good guides for mail server 
What OS are you using? 
I had to read like 3 different guides throughout the process 
And ended up needing to dig thorugh specific postfix man pages in the end 
Debian 7 
on muh server 
Yeaaa so the problem with this guide 
Is that it locks you out of vmail 
No PostfixAdmin or Roundcube either 
So as far as the mail server goes 
How many domains do you own 
Do you want to send emails from all fo them 
uh 
one 
Do you want to send emails from more than one user? 
I want to send it from plsnotice.me :3 
ya 
I would want a couple to use 
Ok so lemme just explain how vmail vs. normal mail works 
normal mail (as this guide does it), is user based 
mail will be delivered to a directory in your home dir 
You should be able to hook up your own mail client 
Because that's what dovecot does 
:o 
But in order to add a new user 
You have to basically 
Create a new user on your computer 
Give thema mail dir 
Then alter your postfix alias maps so that the user gets mail 
basically it's a bit of a PITA 
But not to say it's undoable 
Also if you ever get a new domain 
Then it'll be a big PITA 
Well if you want to send mail from it 
Because you have to setup lots of silly aliasing crap -- basically no fun 
vmail basically involves setting stuff up so that you have a single user who manages "virtual mail" for everyone 
You use a SQL DB to store information about users, mail addresses, etc. 
And if you set it up with postfix admin 
You acn basically just click a few buttons and add in new users, etc. 
Basically it makes your life very easy 
That sounds much easier 
mail servers are bitches 
But it's a bit more of a pain to setup than non vmail 
I agree bo1g 
I dunno how I did it 
But it werks :^) 
I had mine working day one 
and then I look a few days ago 
and it doesnt anymore 
and I'm like yeee whateva 
Err that's weird 
Mine mails been working fine for like the month or so since I set it up 
probably a services thing I set up 
since vultr restarted my vps twice 
>.> 
probably an issue with service 
s 
OVH has never restarted anything of mine 
I cant be assed to look 
yeah I was surprised myself 
I mean vmail services is just postfix, dovecot, mysql, spamassassin tbh 
At least in my setup 
I just did postfix dovecot minimum 
was using it with thundabird 
and my phone 
Yea I use thunderbird + phone too 
Also have roundcube thoguh 
Which is bretty nice 
requires PHP though doesnt it? 
Err yea 
that's why I was like NEXT TUTORIAL 
PHP was a minor bitch to get working 
Because my server apparently fucking hates unix sockets 
It only does net sockets 
php worst 
Meh, not really 
just setup openbasedir 
do some minor php.ini changes 
Then properly get FASTCGI configs in nginx or whatever apache does 
I'll probably need to set it up when I get a client that's like "wordpress theme pls" 
Like the real bitch imo was getting everything routing properly 
but ewwwwwwwwww 
I'm so damn glad I knew MYSQL when I was working with Dovecot/Postfix 
Beacuse I ended up having to write my own queries for stuff 
Well more like modify the queries to get them to properly interact 
But being able to know how to use MySQL was bretty nice 
Probably wouldn't have figured shit out otherwise 
yeee 
I should do mine that way 
so I'm fucked lol 
rip wiz 
No you aren't 
I had weird complications on my system 
I have no idea what kind fo weird complications you'll have 
but you have this and #linux as support channels 
I got by without asking anyone 
But it costed me like 2-3 days of freetime setting shit up 
And yea bo1g vmail is the sane way to do things 
Otherwise it's like 
Hmm, I wanna add a mail address to send mail from 
1. Make new user with homedir, mail dir etc. 
lol 
2. Modify the username:password file or whatever you're using to store auth. for postfix 
3. Modify aliases table so that the address actually works 
I think that is it tbh 
But it's so silly 
To have to have junk users on your computer because you wanted mail 
ALso yea make sure you setup your DNS properly too WizBright 
2 things you have to do 
rDNS 
that's most important 
then SPF records 
SPF records are only really important when you have multiple domains 
basically if your mailserver =/= your mail address 
Because you have to verify that "X domain is registered to send mail from Y server" 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
you got this bro 
no one can do it 
but yoo 
Again, you have this channel + $linux to help 
#linux 
I know that mal also setup a mail server 
It's painful if you don't have someone else to ask questions 
Like I got hung up on various problems for like hours at a time because google wasn't useful 
so RTFM was the only thing I could really do 
Thankfully you have me so you'll be good :^) 
I definitely didn't use hackiness and other manners of modifying stuff so it somehow werked, trust me. 
Oh god i'm remember Arch Wiki's tut. on this 
CREATE USER postfix_user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'hunter2'; 
well 
I'm not sure where to start 
oh well 
Gonna stay up so I can dl some of the books then I'll go to bed 
There's plenty of guides 
Find one that you think you can follow and link it 
I'll tell you my thoughts 
they split the steps into different articles but it's the first one to mention vmail

The tutorial

you want to use postfix admin 
Hell, you can probably just use SQL stuff 
But you will have to learn SQL to do stuff which isn't all that fun >.>

Nathan is an asshole though 
Oh you're only 30 mins in 
I mean I appreciated some of the writing 
But overall 
I didn't come out of that feelling like it was some kind of groundbreaking scifi 
I'm enjoying it for what it is so far

oh god Luminarys 
#linux is hurting me 
It is? 
I have to defend vim's good name 
I knew you would 
I feel like he has no idea about linux lol 
He knows OSX 
And he knows what the fuck he's doing there 
lol 
OSX = UNIX = Linux right? 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
I mean I respect people who know their shit 
So I deal with him saying some silly things about Linux 
Also he likes little girl shows 
lol 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
So he's automatically a good person in my books 
That is the face of sadness 
You should be more like snowfag WizBright 
am I a good person in your books 
He watches little girl shows 
He understands the true way 
I hope at least 
Maybe~ 
or he is a .pdf :^) 
lol 
Damn the server I'm working on lacks MySQL header files >.>

Oh boy 
You're getting to the end 
damn 
that was a good movie 
at least to me 
I was hoping that Nathan would be revealed as an AI 
But damn 
Le AI is evil :^) 
I enjoyed it 
But not ground breaking to me or anythin 
As a movie goer 
I found it very visually pleasing plus the soundtrack 
Visually it was bretty gud 
Decent OST, but not incredible for me 
It fit the movie well 
also I don't think it should look like that lol 
all them index files 
Oh yea thats from wget 
It's not a problem 
I'll go through it later and delete it >.> 
That doesn't look like ranger 
But I can't tell 
Yea just do a recursive delete with find or something 
it's in w3m 
I think 
Oh interesting 
whoa 
w3m ~ 
try it 
w3m is a good textmode browser 
its p gr8 
ur gr8

Hmm 
for some reason urxvt doesn't want to let me click :< 
well that was interesting though 
hmm 
du says that the directory is up to 30GB now 
but it doesn't seem like it 
Almost done :3 
Trust me 
There's THOUSANDS of books in there 
My only complaint is that for a few topics they're out of date 
But they have all the classics 
dragon book, sicp, knr, clsr 
Basically the gud stuff 
yes 
but 
Nothign really good for android dev tho >.> 
the prog books are at the end I assume 
because they haven't been populated to the directories 
Maybe not 
Also why do you use dropbox for everything >.> 
Is there nothing in the Programming/ Dir? 
I only use it for some images I don't want elsewhere 
wut 
when did you find that.. 
5 seconds ago 
5 seconds ago i started googling. 
This sounds like a honeypot :^) 
first page. 
muh duckduckgo didn't show me 
Use startpage dude 
Oh my god what is this site 
>We host ponies 
>en même 
Dear lord 
lol 
its french 
its just online.net landing page 
pls 
This is pretty hilarious tho 
Does en meme actually mean meme? 
no 
it means "even" 
Shit 
I was convinced they were spouting dank memes >.> 
this is cool :o 
Err wut? 
They wrote an IRC bot 
Whcih I guess is cool 
Considering it's from scratch 
just a reuglar python bot pff 
Better than onee-chan :^) 
doubt it 
Yea pmuch my thoughts Liseda 
But it's still neat 
Hmm 
what to have for breakfast 
klondyke bar 
I just gave away all my mtg cards ever 
feels fuckin GREAT 
w-wut 
;~; 
you should've given them to me 
nah you should also get away from it 
expensive ass hobby 
┐(￣ー￣)┌ 
used to love it though until all my friends just bought cards to win 
did you play standard or modern? 
remember when you could buy packs and build decks on that based on what you found 
good times 
I was a casual 
ahh 
I play at my local store a lot 
I played for fun 
I'm decent there 
with my friends I rekt them 
then my friends would just "look at my five mill decks" or "you're dead turn one" and I was like fuck this 
they are also not friends anymore 
oh well it's weight off my chest 
┐(￣ー￣)┌ 
if I ever have an opportunity though I want to play Weiss Schwarz 
I have a deck 
I'm making a $400-$500 deck right now 
ew 
but i'm buying/trading for the cards 
yeah I had 5000 unsorted grab bag cards 
then my decks I'd say 300~ cards total 
then my 200 sorted uncommons 
then my dice, counters, and play mat and covers 
100ish rares 
damn 
any good rares/mythics? 
my favorite was possibility storm 
lol 
I had a pretty rare one 
it was a planeswalker 
liliana? 
forget 
Ahh 
what set did you start playing at lol 
I started 2014 not too long ago 
with the black/white lifegain deck 
She's not bad 
I started in 2011 I think 
one of my favorites but I should probably update it as it changed in the final iteration 
also that was a super fun one 
when it decided to work 
weiss schwarz needs an online variation 
I feel like I'm the only one in the area with a deck lol 
lol 
kinda want to make some sort of card battle game but that's tough RPG balancing shit that I'm not sure if I'm ready to get into 
it seems cool 
but I would want a deck full of my waifus 
could barely get a cube to move across a plane in unity 
thats another challenge 
finding artists lol 
true 
a more stragegic and involving version of Kancolle would be awesome 
I mean I can still make the game with placeholders 
I guess 
just going past that point 
maybe I'll 
try some things 
not like it's a 3D shootem 
ya :o 
my original idea was some sort of chef/cooking system 
and you would battle other chefs and dishes would deal damage 
or something 
and your team would have your head chef and a soux chef then 3-4 line chefs 
then you have to equip with utensils 
and ingredients 
post apocolyptic cooking game 
then the main head chefs can specialize in a area like italian or japanese food 
I'm just splurging ideas sorry lol 
I should try cooking up something, no pun intended 
not sure if unity is the best for this sort of thing 
should be fine 
actually 
the player should be the head chef 
and the soux chef is your waifuchef 
oh man 
IDEAS 
I would play that 
:o 
Sounds like Shokugeki to me doe 
a little bit 
thought about that too 
I'd say that shokugeki is more competitive as opposed to a player vs boss situation but it depends on how it ends up 
my "idea" is that the soux chefs could be based off of dishes? 
then i can do the five elements shebang and base it around the five tastes 
the system builds itslef 
itself* 
then that way you can "craft" chefs by cooking your own dishes 
or something 
not sure about that if your attack mech is cooking 
:o 
bo1g dumb gamedev NERD 
Lel unity 
meh 
doing stuff from the ground is dumb 
too much work 
Yea that's true, but what little I know about Unity makes me go meh 
its not pretty 
or optimized 
thats fors ure 
unreal engine should have linux export now i think which is p nice 
I don't know anything =D 
I think that's all of us >.> 
sup 
hi 
how are you~ 
deeeeecent 
Yay 
Finally finished making an API for my server 
currenly downloading the whole base and base-devel from the arch repos 
So I can actually upload files to it and retrieve them 
Well technically a Web API 
oh, in what? 
PHP 
I mean how else do you do it simply? 
anything? :D 
python can do it 
lel 
Not running a third gunicorn instance 
i think bo1g did something simple in python too 
i did mine in Go 
I need to get around to learning Go 
i like it 
makes you realize how much packaging is a bitch for python 
orly 
ya rly 
Seems interesting 
Just curious Liseda, with your API how are you storing the files? 
I'm hashing them and storing them based on the hash name in an external directory in /home(because le partition space) 
randomized string 
check if the string is already taken, if so; generate a new 
just like that 
lol 
Yea that makes the URLs nicer because le short 
yah 
But md5 means I can spam duplicates for testing 
And le space is saved 
my script runs every image through optipng anyway 
so hashing wouldn't be a good idea because it might not be the same after anyway 
I think there's a low chance of collision because I store hash.ext 
Hmm, probably should do that for my image files 
takes a bit longer 
Well sure 
nerds 
ur a nerd 
where is your python knowledge 
He needs to git gudder 
So do I >.>

Luminarys: 
which book should I read for python from the library :^) 
Err, not too sure 
I use the python cheatsheet from there though 
That's really handy 
Honestly just read the most recent book you can 
lol ls | grep "2014" ? 
2011 is the most recent lmfao 
Yea probably should go with that 
What you shoulda done is grep "20\d\d" then sort 
Actually idr if you can do a sort based on your grep 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Just do the python3 
hmm 
should I use firefox for pdfs or get a seperate thing 
Meh, doesn't make a big difference 
Though I do like zathura

I wish my bf would split a single room with me >_< 
Oo how long have you been with him :V

That's not how it werks 
Damn, I'm running like 3 gunicorn instances on my server as well as gogs 
so whose server is this hosted on? 
Mine 
I don't do anything with my server anyways, so I was like "whatever" 
:V 
time to post it on /g/ 
Huh, that's where I found out about this 
This guy basically posted and I offered to host stuff 
why 
would anyone 
sane 
want to host anything related to files 
and 4chong 
Why not :^) 
have fun getting your server shutdown 
Also that implies I'm a sane person 
Ya I can feel the CP incoming 
Anyways, I have virus scanning on and have an abuse address, I don't think it'll be too big of an issue 
Also I find it unlikely this is going to go anywhere 
It's just yet another fun thing for me to do 
well, that's what the pomf guy thought too 
and look how well it went :^) 
you're not going to even going to last the 1/10 time like him if it actually gets popular 
Perhaps not 
Also ya WizBright, do you wanna play xmage or what? 
xmage is still giving me a port issue 
we could try cockatrice? 
Hmmm 
not as automated but still good 
What's the error? 
^ the keybindings are helpful 
I'm using port 17171 
it's probably the router 
Are you connecting to xmage.woogerworks.com with port 17171? 
yep 
I should get around to setting up a vpn on my server 
so I can get around some problems 
OpenVPN isn't that hard 
lol 
Well to setup 
I have received a letter from a law firm representing Hasbro Germany, expressing a strong feeling of dislike for our project, backed up with legal claims. Regardless of whether the claims they are making are factually correct or not, I have agreed to shut down the project in its current form. As soon as this is completely sorted out, development work will be put into keeping alive the code base 
in such a way that it can be used for other purposes. 
lel 
lol wut 
from woogerworks? 
or? 
Good thing someone else picked it up 
ty based woogerworks 
Ah ok 
Install guide for Arch: Cockatrice is available compiled with Qt5 in the AUR as cockatrice-git 
Le based AUR 
I know right :^) 
yaourt cockatrice-git :^) 
yaourt -S 
no fuckin around 
o 
I haven't been using it 
with the s 
I mean it just acts like pacman 
also your decks might need to be remade to .dec or whatever wooger uses 
If you know your package name -S should be used 
Yea whatever 
lel 
Well, I only made one deck, so it's not a major deal 
when you hop on, the game name is Luminarys please 
make sure to run oracle before cockatrice

Oh man I'm gonna have to reDL the database of cards

I took them out for the first time in like a year last night

Yep 
Most of my decks are the cheap plastic ones 
Ultra Pros are dragon shields 
But a few have actual nice sleeves 
or* 
Man I don't remember at all >.> 
lol 
inb4 cheap sleeves 
rip cards （ ´_ゝ`）

Very intense 
lissy, he has stuff worth money ;~; 
This is the only way I can feel good about myself after losing >.> 
I hate you 
so much 
Don't think I have beta 
It's Revised 
Which is pmuch about 10$ less 
$60 
still not bad 
Ya, I also have revised demonic tutors 
Err not revised 
$15 each 
I can't tell 
lol 
unlimited? 
either way 
your binder is worth monies 
;~~~~; 
Meh, I like the nostalgia of this binder 
It has a shitton of rares tho 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
I'd estimate 175~ 
stop rubbing it in.. 
Meh, most are crappy 
pls 
This is just kinda fun to look through 
Oh hmm 
Perhaps I was mistaken about my # of goblin guides 
Actually only have 4 >.> 
I thought I had 4 in one deck and 2 in another, looks like it was 2/2 
Lel I have 2 stoneforge mystics it seems 
Those are fun 
Man my decks are hella unoptimized 
lol 
Ya demonic tutor is unlimited 
The white borders 
Luminarys: want to play again? 
Luminarys: （ ´_ゝ`） 
In a few 
Ill copy pasta another one of my shitty decks 
:^) 
Lel, right 
k lemme whip up le deck 
Okay almost done 
woo 
I'm watching a legacy game anyways lol 
Alright starterino ing 
Luminarys: 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
shit 
6/1/2011 
6/1/2011 
it's a 0/0 
Well that was fun 
Holy shit I need to sleep 
same lol 
I'm an hour ahead :^) 
I found you Liseda 
Mei-mei:

W-well 
I mean, fujoshi is a calling after all 
There are certain things that you just can't fight 
:^) 
Mei-mei hides in a corner 
Do you wear glasses too? 
Gotta fit the persona :3 
Shit, I just woke up and it's 1 >.> 
lol 
nice 
lol 
I'm doing a draft Luminarys 
Those are fun 
See, hearthstone makes you spoiled wtih this 
lol 
Because there's an entire game mode which is drafting and playing your deck against other people 
It's actually bretty great 
oh arena 
but 
not the same as 8 player drafting 
Ya, not quite the same as passing around boosters 
But still pretty similar 
sup Luminarys 
Hi :3 
What are you up to :V 
Programmin 
wanna magic more :^) 
I got a fun legacy deck to play :^) 
Hmm, perhaps in a bit 
also whats the card above your diamond faire 
I want a copy :D 
Err 
Zur the Enchanter 
yesh 
I wanna make a commander deckout of him 
Holy shit these things are worth money 
Well 5 bucks 
I thought it was pretty shitty >.> 
I'd give you $5 or trades 
:^) 
I'll think about it, since I have no decks which I could use him in 
Except like some artifact deck, but there's no real synergy there 
you have two? 
I only need one~ 
Ya i have two 
:3 
let me know when you want to battle Luminarys :) 
i'll battle you irl 
fists against fists 
you'll get fucked up m8 
:^) 
That's probably true though 
I weigh 115 lbs 
pls 
I could take you lissy 
lol ye rite

Hi! 
hi 
WizBright waves 
Hiii 
>.> 
What :o 
My nvidia device doesn't like me 
Rip 
I mean I'm trying to get it to work so I can train an RNN faster 
Run? 
Rnn*? 
Recurrent neural network 
Basically I'm trying to make a Lib-bot 
So I scraped /pol/ 
And am training the network with it 
I used the official API too :^) 
Nerd :^) 
This is going to take 3/4 of a day to train fully without a GPU >.> 
Welp 
Iteration 1000 of the RNN is done 
It's learned how to greentext 
">will nigger to breadballest up the hards are to years tored. F86T." 
Seems legit 
How are you creating such a network? 
What sort of program lol 
Oh FFS 
my GPU is now arbitrarily recognized 
Welp, fuck you too nvidia 
Holy fuck GPU compyutation is 20x faster than CPU 
Well actually 15x 
Damn this is gonna finish in an hour 
based CUDA 
I should scrape r9k and run it on that too 
That'd be pretty hilarious 
Actually I should scrape every single >tfw 
And make a >tfw generator 
sup 
I missed how you did this 
I am on my lappy now 
Luminarys pls 
Huh? 
Oh 
The 4chins AI 
hehe 
It finished training and the results are interesting 
It's not exactly perfect though 
But 
I forgot the prog you were using for this :o 
Torch7 
ttps://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn 
With that 
WizBright pokes Luminarys 
:3 
Mmm? 
lol 
look in #linux 
;~; 
hi lissy 
I was in canada 
it was nice 
nice 
I also found your theme in my old backups Liseda 
I love it blue :3 
lol 
Canada is nice >.> 
it is 
many qt asians too :3 
lol 
wtf 
Just go to Cali 
It's not different tbh 
At least 30% Asian in the more populous suburban areas 
but I want the koreans :< 
inb4 lissy calls me bad things 
Why Koreans in particular? 
ur gay 
you like gay things lissy-poo 
WizBright finds koreans to be prettiest asian 
not that kind of gay 
;~; 
yellowfever is weird 
lol 
I mean 
sure m8 
I like asians 
they all look the same 
all white people look the same too 
lmfao 
eh there are difference is asians 
you can tell who the vietnamese are easily 
and chinese 
then moving to koreans/japs 
But I guess they are all muddled together to be honest 
. 
but you can tell 
But they all look the same :^) 
Well suit yourself lel 
The only Asians I find attractive are Chinese, but this is most likely because I'm Chinese >.> 
>caring about nationality 
I mean more like ethnic groups that tend to overlap with nationality 
Also nice slurs WizBright :^) 
wut 
lol 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
It's not nice to call Japanese people 'Japs' >.> 
I am sorry 
Not like I actually care 
for the sake of typing whiile doing shit 
i did so 
I was just being sarcastic lel 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Actually I shoulda just trained Lib bot on Libs actual IRC messages 
That's not enough training materiel though 
I should try training on everyone on IRC< that would actaully be pretty funny 
Make fake logs 
kek 
do it 
do it from #horriblesubs on rizon 
I can provide logs if needed :3 
Gimme 
lol 
HS would probably be funnier 
The more consistent the better 
sure 
I haven't gone through it 
so it may need some editing but idk 
You shouldn't have to edit anything 
Like timestamp/nick is fine 
lol 
it's 31MB 
Great 
That's a shitton of training data 
I might actualy have to cutdown on that 
It's like 1:30 per 1MB of data 
Of training time 
lol 
well it's a years worth or more 
Luminarys: https://www.dropbox.com/s/5glh223r6hxrx1b/%23horriblesubs.log?dl=0 
let me know what you think after you've looked through it 
is it usable? 
k 
This should be great 
I'm gonna split it up into 5MB chunks though 
Jeez my work's internet is terrible 
I get lag on SSH when DLing stuff >.> 
kek 
you're doing this at work? 
:P 
Alright, RNN is starting to train 
0.33S per batch, 100k batches 
The nice thing is, it actually creates checkpoints 
And you sample off the checkpoints 
So once I get a checkpoint with low enough loss, I'll just use that and see what happens 
what will the network do? 
form sentences? 
Learn a language 
Just look at some of the examples 
Damn this is neat 
It's just starterd 
here's results: 
As you can see it's basically learned timestamps and nicks 
Because they appear in every line 
Also it looks like it learned your nick and snowfags nick 
Still can't exactly speak properly 
It almost learned HorribleSubs 
17:55:26 <hatpec> HrripleSuds ITS Fre No 
It seems to be learning emotes as well 
This is actually a really great dataset 
There's a high amount of consistency 
So I'm getting low loss 
:D 
also Luminarys I remade my edh deck 
EDH? 
Which one was that 
Commander 
oh god 
lol 
Luminarys: 
edh game 
noice 
he just said game and left :^) 
16:33:15 <WizBright> ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ 
It's on to you >.> 
lol wut? 
is the network becoming me? 
Possibly 
It seems to know how to emote 
And associates them with you lol 
good :^) 
well they are my logs so 
can he be named 
Wizbote :3 
how's wizbote doing Luminarys 
failing obv 
Well after about 4 full iterations through a 5MB file, it's started to decline in gains 
rude lissy 
you have lots of dada though lol 
data* 
WizBright, pls 
its bound to fail if its named wizbote.. 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
we could rename it to Lisbote 
no 
cause it'll be poo 
lel it made up an anime name: [342M] - [Chahoro_]_Frie___light_Butter_Paid_[878108011-03] 
:o 
Is the announce bot called sadaharu? 
lol 
frie light butter paid 
it's one of them 
wtf 
lol 
it's the front end for Ginpachi-Sensei 
It also came up with a fansub group 
Chahoro! 
I dunno if that's a real fansub group tho 
maybe short for Chihiro 
yeah 
looks close tho chihiro 
Also: 01:48:32 <WizBright> ( ｀ー´) 
lol 
all the emotes 
You're the only one who gets emotes

WizBright • [FFF] Hibike! Euphonium - 11 [22DBBB0D].mkv • 16:50/23:40 • 348MB • Paused 
all this yuri 
ughhhhhh 
no ty 
i liked the start 
still only watched 3 eps 
but everyone talking about the god damn yuri bait 
makes me just want to drop it 
fuck 
no u 
kumiko x Reina 
truth though 
fuck that shit 
ruins everything about the show 
dumbs it down into hrur durr xDDDDd 
please 
so was free 
:) 
Hurry up and get to 12 lel 
It was bretty gud 
I am waiting for FFF 
:3 
WizBright, uh no? 
As far as the Yuri goes, I'm pretty ambivalent 
there were no fucking romance in free 
don't be dumb 
But I really like the instruments 
me too 
And there's not much melodrama 
That OP 
Best OP of season 
It's best for me in the sense it's the only show I'm watching this season >.> 
lol 
WizBright • [Commie] Plastic Memories - 12 [F8463EF7].mkv • 00:01/24:00 • 242MB • Paused 
Also wait I'd say Free is a fair comparison 
more feels incoming 
Like as far as romance subtexts go 
then you're both dumb 
I read some interesting analyses on tumblr about Free 
I think everyone on there was like "therez romanceeee" 
interesting analyses on tumblr 
ok 
I mean you're free to think what you want 
Well they were interesting at the time lel 
I mean in the end 
i've read interesting analyses on 4chan about how hibike is 100% lesbian sex m8 XDdd 
The yuri bait is really just the fans 
And it's pmuch same with Free 
there is literally no yaoi bait in free though 
But there is in Hibike? 
no, i don't think there is any yaoi bait in hibike. 
Well yuri bait 
no, how would i know? 
i've only watched 3 eps 
i literally said 
that people talking about it in a way that makes it stupid 
I don't even know what we're talking about then lol 
And yea, fans tend to that 
No need to let it ruin the show for you 
anime fans are the worst 
I think I'm gonna have to agree with that 
But what do you expect from fans of TV that's targeted at 14 year olds and NEETs? 
95% of anime is either shonen stuff or fap material 
kyoani are the kings at baiting and not showing anything at all though 
and that's what they've been doing all the time 
so its weird if they suddenly do it 
oh well, i can't exactly expect some guy that probably never goes outside 
to actually write decent characters 
but kyoani has usually been the exception 
but they have always been adaptions 
The author the novels? 
of the novels* 
hibike, chuu2, amagi has been fairly in-house 
ie: they didn't buy just buy the license, they bought everything 
Oh rly 
Did they buy the whole K-On franchise? 
nope 
pretty sure they only got the license for the anime and merch 
they don't own the manga etc 
while kyoani personally publish the LN of hibike, amagi, chuu2 
actually i dunno if hibike was actually a ln 
i think hibike is original 
actually nvm, manga adaption 
Hmm, thought it was an LN, guess not 
kyoukai no kanata is another LN they bought and made anime of 
which sucked dick 
Lel yea 
I think WizBright likes it tho >.> 
proof that not even kyoani can save a shitty LN 
wow 
way to throw me under the bus Luminarys 
Oh wait was I being too much an asshole there :| 
Sry WizBright 
lol 
its true tho 
the plot SUCKS 
were you driving the bus too >.> 
it has some good characters though 
like the teacher 
and the spirit mother 
yee 
and the big sister 
but the rest is just garbage 
all the girls are best 
fucking hate the mc 
the onee-chans 
kek 
like 
they made 2 kyoukai no kanata movies too 
why? 
I assume it's because they sold well 
i don't think they actually did 
**5,394 Kyoukai no Kanata 
**5,800 Machine Doll 
lmao machine doll sold more that season 
damn that show sucked even more dick 
It's all about the otaku appeal 
The more they can get the NEETs to buy the better 
well 
*26,601 Infinite Stratos 2 
*12,635 Arpeggio of Blue Steel 
was the same season lo0l 
the otakus would rather buy is 
Wait is this for real 
yes 
I didn't realize Japan was this bad 
IS :^) 
I think I tried watching one episode of that 
Charlotte best girl 
I couldn't torture myself any more 
lol can't believe it was 2013 
pfff 
time2fast 
Aikatsu 2 (4/9) 2078 
Not doing too badly :D 
Though S2 was pretty shit

WizBright • [Commie] Plastic Memories - 12 [F8463EF7].mkv • 17:23/24:00 • 242MB • Paused 
Is Plastic Memories any good 
I doubt I'll be watching it one way or another tho >.> 
i's cute 
it's* 
but the feels man 
might be too heavy for you 
See that's either a very good thing or a very bad thing 
Because if it's overdone it'll be melodramatic and I'll hate it 
Or it could be good 
I get the feeling it'll just be melodrama >.> 
;___________________________; 
>.> 
lol 
plastic memories is awful 
it's almost on par with Angel Beats 
art is good though 
the opening is cool 
i like the intro logo 
You like AB tho WizBright 
If it's on par w/AB then I don't think I'm gonna watch >.> 
i've seen every ep expect the last ep that hasn't been released yet 
lol 
and i think i'd rate plastic memories 5/10 :pP 
So it's just average 
please lissy 
pretty much 
Michiru is best girl though 
or kazuki 
so what 
they have 0.1% screentime 
lol 
Ok I don't think I'll be watchin lol 
plsssssssssssss 
Luminarys: it's cute 
and if you have time why not 
Ya but I don't rly 
>not watching shokugeki for the food porn 
If I had time like last summer 
I'd watch like 15 series 
lol 
if he had time 
Still probably would hate them all >.> 
he should spend it watching something good instead 
Ya 
and plastic memories is not one of the 
m 
lol 
I still need to finish shirobako 
But I need to go and apply for jobs today lol 
Applying for jobs >.> 
yes 
My current job is giving me shit hours 
so time to move on 
even though I have been with them for over 2.5 years 
I kinda just wrote an email to a professor and he was like "sure u can intern" 
And then they were like "gud werk m8 wanna git paid?" 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
I feel like actual coding interviews are gonna be painful 
Le binary tree inversion :^) 
Oh well, I did enough competitve programming that it won't be terrible 
nerd :^) 
:3 
I'm actually kindof jealous though ;~; 
You should be more of a CS nerd WizBright 
lol 
Just spend le time 
nice censoring.. 
ty 
I still have to git gud 
The problem is things 2 do 
no timerino 
:< 
I found a couple places that were hiring but 
i need a >tech job :< 
lol 
why 
because 
I hate retail 
Liseda: you know some Go, right? 
yes 
why 
I'm tinkering around with it 
Playing with channels, but I can't seem to figure something out 
What I'm trying to do is create 3 routines 
oh? 
Which basically pass random number around to eachother on channels 
random numbers* 
But for some reason, after one round of passing, the program seems to exit 
Oh wait, figured it out 
lol 
what was it 
I had to put in an input catcher 
The program was exiting prematurely 
Nothing complex lol 
Go is pretty interesting I have to say 
Also they allow pointers 
That makes me feel good 
Hmm, using a timeout for even a millisecond also works 
Ah I think I get it 
Each round of messages is passed like a stack 
I fiddled with go a bit too :S 
i really need to hunker down and learn a language other than java 
So three messages get passed, then the last worker tries to send 
Hmm, still doesn't make much sense 
So the last worker gets the value, prints the statements 
But then the program exits 
Why is it that the send to a channel which has succesfully sent/receieved a message never goes through? 
Just figure out projects to do WizBright 
yeah 
Ok, so WaitGroup can be used to fix this 
Hmm, this is bretty cool 
I can see why people say Go does concurrency well 
Luminarys: how is planetes? 
Gud 
Well I'd recommend it at least 
:o 
lol 
does it have MEMES like plastic memeries 
if not, WizBright wont like it 
you wut 
rude lissy 
lol 
rip 
lol 
Oh Liseda do you know if there's a way to seed Rand in Go with a string? 
eh, no idea 
>.> 
the seed func is only int64 iirc 
Yea I spent an hour last night figuring out if there was a way around it 
well... you can convert the string... kinda? psuedo string seeding huehue 
Yea I tried that 
a=10, b=11...z=36 
It's just that got too big 
i guess 
Also hmm, how would you write a multipart.File to an actual file? 
io.Copy doesn't seem to do the trick 
Ahh, figured it out 
what did you do different? 
I had already used copy once, so seek was at the EOF 
oh 
So I had did a Seek(0,0) 
Then it worked 
how are you liking go so far 
It's interesting 
It also doesn't seem like the big mess that C++ is 
Also channels and routines are great 
Select channels is bretty neat

What are your thoughts so far? 
I like it :D 
I just fnished ep 2 
tfw I lost my op 
I have work so I should go to bed sadly 
night! 
Night 
lel 
Just got an actually working prototype pomf clone done 
Written in Go 
lol 
nice 
WizBright, damn plastic memes was BAD 
Rly? 
So not even average lol 
i gave it a 5/10 
wow 
not that I care :^) 
ofc you do 
otherwise you wouldn't feel the need to say it 
WizBright, your mean score is 8.2 on mal 
Lel mine is 5.3 apparently 
It's probably a good thing if you rate that high tho 
It means he enjoys what he watches >.> 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
It's all arbitrary anways 
anyways* 
Yea pmuch 
Mean Score: 6.1 
lol 
Luminarys: 
what also controls how windows work other than lxappearance 
I feel like there is another one 
A compositer? 
other than "lxappearance" 
lol 
wat 
I mean I use compton 
Never heard of lxappearance tbh 
its LXDEs setting thingy 
i don't get why you would need it though 
Hmm, theme switcher 
if you don't use whole LXDE 
Just use RiceDB :^) 
just set your theme in .gtkrc-2.0 etc 
meh 
I guess I'll have to live with hexchat looking shitty 
Use weechat or irssi lol 
I am on too many channels on rizon to make it worthwhile 
what. 
lol 
how does that even make any sense 
too many channels to scroll through? 
lol 
and..... hexchat changes that how? 
Seems like it'd be easier in weechat 
you can move important channels to buttons you have easy access to, you could just move to every active channel with alt+a 
and you can even enable the fucking mouse and use it 
I don't fucking know Liseda 
sorry 
you could 
add seperate windows 
for certain channels 
so you would have like 4 less important channels in on window 
and stop taking everything so god damn personal wtf 
lel

That also kinda triggers me 
Meh 
Ok weird 
apparently running with -race stops issues 
How does this even work

Good 
I'm glad it triggers you

WizBright are you enjoying the storms

Le tornadoooo 
ye

why would you know 
I guess not from AB :V 
ofc not

fuck ab users 
no u 
lol Someone who has actually seen what you look like :^) 
Just ab users? 
Or anime watchers in general? 
fuck weebs 
all of dem 
:^) 
ab users 
What do you have against ABusers? 
elitism is gay 
lol 
It's hard to call it elitism when there's open invites tbh 
Although yea 
There is alot of Elitism in the "Screw bakabt" stuff 
i'd want more quality control 
but i mean elitism as the users 
irc is awful 
forum is awful 
every fucking kid thinks the world revolves around them 
pretty sums up the average guy 
I dunno 
Compared to mal 
This place is great 
Forums I can't say much 
ab staff, slowest people ln earth 
and extremely unorganized 
cba to rant on a phone anyway 
typing on it is gay

Luminarys: time for more 
WizBright • [OZC] Planetes E03 'Return Trajectory' [Blu-Ray 720p].mkv • 00:15/25:01 • 420MB • Paused 
Noice 
How are you liking it? 
I like it alot (*￣▽￣*) 
thanks for the rec Luminarys 
np >.< 
Also it gets better 
Like much better in the second half 
It's cowboy bebop-esque with the unique episodes 
plus the cast is great 
The first half is very episodic 
Second half is less so 
They kinda take everything that was built up in the first half 
And pull it all together 
Anyways it's pgreat 
Glad you're enjoyin

Has le addiction set in WizBright? 
hii 
how are you Mei-mei 
that explosion I heard about in taiwan was scary :< 
There was? 
That doesn't sound like fun 
yeah 
it happened during the weekend I think 
it was at a waterpark or nearby 
now the question is, do I want to watch Freezing S2 or more Planetes 
More Planetes :3 
How far in are you? 
Also damn Go is fast compared to Python 
Flask vs. Webgo 
Go is over 3x faster 
And it's doing more 
Throughput of 56k reqs handled per min, Python is about 15k 
These are processed post reqs 
Benchmarking various Pomf clones 
I finished 9 
Thoughts so far? 
I dig it 
freezing s2 lol 
Urgh 
why does PHP always hate me 
HOLY SHIT I HATE PHP 
THe reason it didn't work 
Was because I had my root in a location dir rather than the main server block 
FML 
And now onto the stress testing :3 
Welp, PHP-FPM does better than Python 
But not as good as Go 
It can handle about 34k reqs per second 
I'm gonna try switching to unix socket and see if I can increase throughput 
Looks like it's about the same 
Well with sockets 
lol 
php-fpm more like poop-fpoopm 
pmuch 
Trying to send 10 files per req to PHP I get 14.5k ish reqs per min 
Time to try Go 
And Go is about 21k reqs per min 
A pretty acceptable edge 
Le ugly java graphs 
Mmm 
Just finished hibike 
Dat was really nice 
lol 
tfw still waiting for fff 
Hmm 
I need to come up with a solution for newbies to up all their shit to a central location for a project 
? 
Isn't that called github? 
it's mostly picture files 
and shit like that 
I thought about doing just dropbox 
but owncloud sounds kinda neat 
Host a file server lol 
Dropbox isn't that bad though 
But >B O T N E T 
:^) 
I need to make it super easy 
because most of these people aren't super tech 
Dropbox is good then 
Though ti depends 
So you're aggregating stuff 
But who needs access? 
If everyone needs access to everything dropbox is good 
But if only one person needs access, a file server accessible via web interface might be better 
everyone 
But I also need a system where only the uploader or the host of the box can fiddle with the file(s) 
Yea dropbox seems to make the most sense here 
Or something like dropbox at least 
ye 
Hmm I could do owncloud 
meh 
idk how to change the mysql pass 
after I set it up 
seems meh 
but owncloud would probably work nicely 
what's wrong with just ftp 
because they don't know how to use it lol 
er 
won't be the best for it 
not exactly hard to learn it though 
eh let's say 
it could be 
It's for a weebish project 
with irl friends 
yeah but 
filezilla or something like it 
is basically just filling in a name in host 
then username and password 
everyone can understand drag anad drop 
true but ehhhh 
I would need to jail some shit 
dropbox may be the way to go 
jail? 
whby 
just tell them to use sftp 
and create a new user and let them use sftp instead

ooh~ 
Yea I watched it 
I feel like it's gonna be some black lagoon clone 
I like the OP/ED tho 
looking at internet providers atm 
gotta get somethign for the appartment i move in, in sep 
Are they terrible where you are? 
I mean US is terrible 
well, where i am NOW? yes i can only have 4g lol 
where i'm moving? nope 
fiber 
connected to the ~open fiber network~ 
so i can pick any provider i want 
its pretty nice 
none of that locked down shit 
Sounds nice

tbf always find the most weird things to discuss

ye 
thats the guy you're talking to

Yea ik 
Meh 
He's a weird dude 
at least he's passionate about it.. 
I don't have too much of an issue with it though 
congrats on the apartment lissy

how's your go adventures going Luminarys 
Bretty good 
I'm liking Go 
It seems like a decent way to go fast without having to use C 
Feels alot like a modernized C 
Which isn't surprising given that Thompson helped make it 
lol 
hiii 
sup m8s 
hi nuck 
hey :3 
aloha 
Sup Luminarys ( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ 
I'm like dying here of overworking 
Doing PHP freelance work 
;_; 
rip 
:< 
PHP + JS here 
Thankfully it's not too bad to the point of wanting to blwo my brains out 
But that sucks 
Potentially gonna be getting fulltime job from a design firm though 
Which could be cool 
Noice 
They're basically the #2 design firm in the city 
And they want somebody capable of using this other guy's custom CMS 
And he just trained me on it 
I may get an internship at a company a friend is a senior dev at 
but it'll web stuff 
with 
Which company WizBright? 
I'm in an internship 
>java 
right now 
uh 
modspace.net 
I'm a contracter lol 
something-tech 
Technically an intern tho 
it's local 
Yea that's why I ask 
like 10 minutes away lol 
Just curious if I know the place 
in O'Fallon IL 
Oh, the probably not 
then* 
do you work near boeing? 
at a biotech place? 
It's a bit off of Olive 
ahh 
Speaking of programming hell 
So no Bruce Rogers there? 
Fuck Discourse 
With a rubber mallet 
I've heard of that 
It's that forum software or whatever 
Yeah 
We use it on Hummingbird and I'm doing the chore of updating it right now 
It's a 2-hour ritual 
Oh boy 
damn 
does hummingbird have an anilist importer :3 
Because our CTO was an ass and decided that it woudl be "easier" to fork discourse and rebase our stuff onto it 
Yea 
What would've been a better option? 
Building a plugin 
Has importers for lots of stuff 
Sounds fun 
Is the API shitty or something? 
Not really, he was just too dumb to figure out how to properly use a plugin 
We have to rebase our fork, push that up, rebase our fork of the Dockerfile and rebuild that 
Then rebuild the container based on that Dockerfile 
Ouch 
And we go through this *twice* for each upgrade, at a minimum 
Because we have to do it in staging and then in production 
Sounds like lots of fun 
"staging" is a kind term too 
Technically it's just my home server 
For testing and stuff I assume 
The next 6 months will be a constant battle of undoing all his mistakes now that he's gone 
Yep 
Staging is where we rehearse the upgrade and make sure nothing goes wrong 
Right 
How's the security with Docker? 
What do you mean? 
Has it ever been exploited in hummingbird 
How would you exploit it 
idk 
I do know that Docker has some issues 
It's just chroot jails on steroids 
in that if you get access to it 
You can execute stuff to interfere with other processes 
That was only in old kernels that you could gain root privs from root in the container 
And do stuff like reboot the machine 
Modern kernels don't have that issue 
And more importantly, if they even get into your server at all you're doing it wrong 
We have very little surface area besides HTTP on the servers 
Pretty much just SSH and we don't allow password logins 
Is there any way to access a server outside of getting a priv. key? 
It's PKI only 
I hear Apache can be exploitable 
But I dunno 
We use Nginx 
Probably the sane choice 
If they get into the admin panel they could probably muck around a bit 
But I think they'd still be limited to just the DB 
I assume you have remote backups 
And salted hashed shit 
I actually just realized I don't know if we have backups anymore 
>.> 
Our CTO left without briefing fucking anyone 
Jackass 
Damn 
We've been slowly emailing him to get access to all the servers again 
He's a dumb cunt 
Seems like a dick move 
But we are very good with passwords 
passwords are all bcrypted 
Noice 
Authentication is stored in cookies as a JWT, which is a cryptographically signed base64-encoded JSON string 
Extremely secure, extremely fast 
And extremely extensible :D 
How computationally intensive is bcrypt compared to say SHA256? 
I know SHA256 is somewhat expensive 
Much much more 
Which is good 
SHA256 is not a cryptographic hash 
It's a checksum hash 
Yea it's checksum 
I guess not a totally fair comp. 
The only three good options in password storage are PBKDF2-SHA256 (which basically feeds something through SHA256 hundreds or thousands of times), bcrypt, and scrypt 
bcrypt and PBKDF2-SHA256 are both computationally expensive, while scrypt is memory expensive 
In all cases the goal is that password hashing should take a long time — generally I calibrate to ~300ms 
Does that every impact server performance in a signficant way? 
ever* 
Not really 
Or rather, in performance analysis, do you know how much CPU time the hashign is taking? 
Logins are pretty uncommon 
The basis of the "expensive hashing" concept is that you only need to do it at login once, while a brute force attack needs to do it billions of times in a short period of time 
but still 
any Anilist > hummingbird importer 
if so, I would move to HB 
Not officially 
Well not any, but lots 
:< 
At least last time I checked 
I've actually been working on an interface to make it so we can add list importers easily 
:D 
So anything which implements the ListImport interface (technically not a real thing, just duck-typed) will be able to import 
noice 
I would join the HB botnet if it had it :3 
The ListImport currently consists of implementing an #each method I think 
My first target with that is HB list-backup restoration 
Then AniDB because it's a low-hanging fruit 
Then on from there 
Hoping to land OAuth2 within the next month but I'm currently waiting on our designer :< 
nuck is a man of many hats 
too many hats, not enough heads 
lel 
WizBright looks for a hat rack for nuck 
lol 
hmm any other recs for animu Luminarys 
I am in a downloading mood 
inb4 added to backlog 
Boku no Pico :D 
I'm not into shota 
I wanna get rich and pay for that to be dubbed 
:o 
I've already cast it 
Gilbert Gottfried as Pico, Gary Busey as the guy who fucks Pico, Bill Cosby as the car they fuck in, and Bryan Cranston in a dress as Chico's sister 
lol 
Oh and Steve Buscemi as Chico and Danny DeVito as Coco (the strange fairy shota) 
Looks like I got the ball rolling again on this upgrade. That's good. 
nice :o 
Hmm 
I have a button 
that I need to find a soundbite to have it randomly execute 
or I wonder if I could have it play a random song from mpd 
hmm the options

I'm not sure what layouts sweden has for flats 
bathroom, kitchen 
1 room appartment would mean that there isn't a seperate living room/bedroom

Didn't catch the ref. at all lel 
Man Of Constant Sorrow is a large part of the film lol

I'm guessing HS 
Oh ya 
I don't care much about sub groups 
lol 
so long as the subs themselves don't look shitty 
lol 
CR is shit though 
I understand 50% of what people are saying anyways 
they don't even typeset 
I just need subs for specific stuff 
wow nerd 
Just git gud :3 
>CR is shit though 
well.. thank god that 99% of the anime this season is funi 
xddddddddddddddddd 
I'll wait for a real group anyways :^) 
holy shit man 
Charlotte 
fucking hilarious 
This dude is such a massive prick 
Like ultra pretentious asshole lelouch 
I'm laughing so hard at this shit 
lol 
WizBright, meh 
Holy shit 
i usually watch the first release that exists of the airing onees for the f irst ep at least 
So to get a girl to like him 
He gets a truck to nearly run into here 
her* 
and then saves her himself 
no point waiting 1 week~ for a release for a show you might not even like 
All the while thinking "hahahahaha I'm so gr8" 
I don't even know what to think of this show 
It's like so bad it's good 
lol 
Also https://fuwa.se/rwmlc.png 
Not even subtle 
kek 
lel /a/ = 
I am so sick of these edgelord Death Note style immoral "natural selection = good" MCs. If you're literally out of middle school you should hate this faggot MC. 
Sounds about right 
i bet R4 on AB would love him 
Isn't that the guy with the onii-sama prof pic? 
yeah 
If you unironically like mahouka, then you probably might like this 
the guy that has super awful english and cringeworthy signature and title 
lmao 
It's more funny than cringeworthy tbh 
I like mahouka... 
... 
For shame dude 
but onii-sama ;~; 
i didn't even wtach that show 
because it looked like poop 
It was poop 
I suffered through like 3/4 
then gave up 
I suffered through your MOM 
kek 
Probably not as bad as the show 
Holy shit this premise 
is so bad 
At least there's a cute onee-chan 
or imouto i guess 
God this writing is terribad 
lol 
seems PROMISING 
Yea makes up for the rest of the shit 
Kinda 
She actually seems like an above average character tho 
lelel crunchyroll 
they subbed siscon as siscom 
lol 
It's a mistype 
it should be socom 
kek 
did you watcha nything else yet? 
Gangsta 
Just those two so far 
will watch God Eater 
possibly whatever Madhouse is putting out 
I've watched Gangsta. and uh.. Okusama ga Seitokaichou! 
Not too sure what to think of Gangsta 
i like it 
the deaf scenes were p good 
I don't think it's terrible 
feels like they bothered to put some effort into it 
Oh yea that was interesting 
Ya 
It's hard to tell with these shows 
It might go somehwere interesting 
some guy with a sword just killing shitloads of people that has guns is kinda lame though 
Or it might just end up being an edgy bloodbath 
but i can't be too greedy 
Yea that fight was weird 
people literalyl just watchign him 
with guns in their hands 
not doing jackshit 
I went wth 
i'll try to wtach 
uh 
Wakaba*Girl, Shimoneta longtitleblablabal, Rokka no Yuusha, Ranpo Kitan: Game of Lapace, Charlotte 
today 
oh yeah, Gate too I guess 
I'm totally turned off by Laplace's premise 
a friend told me it was surprisingly promising 
I probably should be too by Charlotte, but dammit Key 
yea I've had two people say it's decent 
If you watch it, plz give me an opinion 
I might consider watching 
yea we'll see lol 
i still have some backlog to finish too 
did FFF release last hibike yet even 
Hmm, idk 
I liked Hibike tho 
7/10 
I feel like Kyoani actually cared about stuff 
> some guy with a sword just killing shitloads of people that has guns 
SAO: GGO 
Right there 
I'm mad I didn't drop that before the second cour 
Wasted 5 hours of my damn life 
That's me + anime 
Watch crap 
regret it 
lol 
continue to watch crap 
I actually like GGO 
Because kirito is adorable 
And Lisbeth is adorable 
i don't think there is any difference in the arcs of sao 
And sinon girl has a nice ass 
they are all poop 
If there's cute girls, it can be semi tolerable 
I don't pay attention to the action or w/e 
Just the cuties 
the last arc was kinda funny though 
But only somewhat 
tbh my favorite shows generally let me self-insert somehow 
In SAO there's Lisbeth, in PMMM there's Sayaka 
my friends in japan took a group pic with this guy http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140717084253-pkg-ripley-japan-inspirational-cross-dresser-00005510-story-top.jpg today 
kinda jealous.. 
That man is a hero 
why don't you self-insert as kirito nuck 
;^) 
you know 
what pisses me off with sao most? 
that no one 
took advantage of the ggo arc in doujins 
with kirito as a guy 
Because I want kirito to glop me 
there are some but he's 100% female in those doujijns 
WASTE OF CREATIVITY 
I've seen ones with him as a guy 
oh? 
Like 2 of 'em 
Not nearly enough doujins of SAO 
Especially with best girl lisbeth

lel 
I actually really like SAO 
It's shit 
But I enjoy it 
The tech is pretty fun to imagine too 
And they go down interesting roads with it 
Especially when you get to Alicization 
i gave first season a 5/10 and the 2nd 6/10 
I give first cour a 7/10, second cour a 3/10 
I still haven't seen third or fourth cour 
But I've read the LNs 
And they're kind of blah 
GGO arc was awkwardly paced and mostly good just for trap kirito and sinon's ass 
it was incredible slow in the anime lol 
literally nothing happens for like 4 eps 
And it almost felt like a buildup to Alicization because it kind of was 
Exactly! 
then you have kirito whining for 2 eps too 
nothing happens either 
It's like 2 days but you can't make 2 days = 10 episodes 
That's just not possible 
If SAO 2 were, say, 12 episodes for all of GGO and maybe a sidestory 
That would be reasonably 
They could have also stretched the GGO arc a lot better 
It feels like the one-episode investigation during SAO S1 
Just stretched over a dozen episodes instead of just one 
i liked accel world more than sao anyway :^= 
was not 
I couldn't deal with the mc from AW 
feel the need to self-insert? 
xd 
There's a lot of guys that would like to insert into her ;) 
wow 
rude Liseda 
no u

Hibike S2 a possibility 
Please KyoAni 
Make more decent stuff

Well suit yourself lel 
I mean did you watch the whole thing 
more Kimiko and Reina for us 
Though tbh its not like it got really better from the start 
>FFF hasn't finished it yet ;~; 
Just was pretty decent all the way through 
Lel 
Also Natsuki 
So many nice looking characters 
ye 
Also lel, you gonna watch Charlotte? 
idk 
I'll see who is going to sub it 
You liked AB right 
Lel man 
AB?.. 
Why would you watch a show based on subs 
Angel beats 
OOOOOooooo 
yes 
The other key/PA original 
Exact same people doing it 
Lots of similarities 
For me thats a bad thing 
I want good typesetting and a reduction of memes if possible 
But you might like it 
No comemes lel 
:^) 
CR is still better than Funi 
Tho not exactly great 
Im not really picky with subbing as long as it isnt terrible 
Everyone uses CR scripts anyways 
so why not wait for ACTUAL typesetting 
instead of lazily putting text on general area of screen 
Yea sometimes its annoying 
But not enough to stop me 
kek 
I feel too elite for that now :^)

good song 
CR at least tries to do LITTLE typesetting 
funi just places it in the same row as the rest of the subs lol 
kek 
Also funi seems to like using nasty yellow subs 
Not sure why they do it tbh 
yellow fever 
hahahahhah 
what the fuck.. 
Shimoneta sure was... special. 
too bad it is a funi rip 
i hope someone subs it 
because damn funi does one extremely shitty job

Oh god the forum thread on "Putting a woman on the 10$ bill" 
This is so terribad 
>Leftists know that if they were to judge on achievement alone, no woman would be worthy of making it on currency. 
Is this even troll? 
>I agree that no woman in history has done something more deserving than anything anyone on our currency, but I am also a humanist. 
When did I start reading /pol/? 
>When you're talking about immigration policy, I also hate soft policies. I support immediate deportation of all illegals, even if they were born here with no questions asked. I have no sympathy for them because they are committing a crime, leeching tax dollars, and stealing jobs. 
lmaoooooo 
I'm outta here before I lose more brain cells 
I do have a bouncer

I might've liked it more 
But then they just turn it into generic magic high school shit 
And it's going to have a bunch of dumb melodrama

Noice 
Oh yay 
You finished Hibike(I assume) 
nope 
waiting for 13 from FFF 
finished danmachi though 
time to get ready for overnights 
( ´ ▽ ` )ﾉ 
Ewww 
I watched one episode of that shit and dropped 
As Demo says "Sword Art Online Big Titties Edition" 
The Hestia maymays were 3dank5me 
Oh my god 
someone uploaded about 10 ISIS videos to Fuwa.se 
Dayummm 
Akagami no Shirayuki-hime 
Finally a good fucking show 
THis is like Yona but actually decent 
>fuwa.se 
It makes me happy that even though pomf is dead the spirit lives on 
time to upload VIRUS to fuwa.se 
you're a virus 
:( 
Please Liseda 
Theres a daily virus scan 
lol 
>signature scanning 
pls 
Lol 
All Windows executable files are banned 
And ClamAv can scan compressed files, Ive seen it remove some 
should just allow images tbh 
or like webm 
Meh 
I talked with someone about this 
And he said that was the best option 
But me+guy who wrote most of Fuwa want to be more in the spirit of pomf 
do you guys even check if images are actually images 
We don't care 
Actualyl Fuwa is really dumb in the backend rigth now 
I'm proposing changes 
well 
There is no DB 
or even flatfile 
To prevent collisions 
even if you allow most of the stuff, it should p smart to check if the file is actually what it says 
It's just Python's random number generator being seeded by a hash 
pomf used mysql right? 
Correct 
Sto uses Sqlite 
Like Sto has a very sane backend imo 
Basically, what's not sane is using a seeded rng thing to detect similar files 
much better to use hashes 
Actually the primary bottleneck in Sto is hashing files 
Takes up 20-30% of CPU time 
Even with concurrency optimizations 
Oh god, calculating birthday attack probabilties for Fuwa 
It would only take 5k uploads to get to 25% collision chance 
Actually, one of the things about Pomf that I don't really get is how the decision to check for name collisions with DB queries instead of FS checks 
is the decision* 
My code is just: 
name := "" 
for name = RandFileName(ext); exists("files/" + name[0:3] + "/" + name[3:]); name = RandFileName(ext) { 
} 
Of course that means once the namespace is exceeded it'll break 
But the actualy chance of getting that many uploads seems low 
I cut up some brussel sprouts and saute'd them in butter and garlic 
then added white wine and let that cook out then some S&P 
so goooood 
Hmm, brussel sprouts are one of the few things I dislike 
you'd like these 
p good 
I used to hate them but saute'd and shit is good 
I just can't take the bitterness 
these aren't even sweet man 
bitter* 
it's p tasty tbh 
Perhaps one day I'll like them 
let me cook them for you m8 
:O 
:3 
Did you pull them apart or did you just throw sprout and all into the sautee? 
sliced them 
softened them a bit in the butter 
but they still were a bit firm so they had a bit of crunch per say 
crunchy 
rolls? 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
It sounds so good T_T 
it twas 
:3 
FUSE everything 
neat :o 
Oh yea I saw that on HN the other day 
Watched Overlord 
pretty meh 
What's with madhouse and their dumb autotune OP/EDs these days 
at least it wasn't screamo crap 
Felt like it was made for 12 year olds as usual tho 
Writing pretty meh 
lol 
did you watch the funi rip 
Yea I think I did 
Was pretty terrible 
kept stuttering all the time 
? 
the video 
Oh, weird 
I've sometimes had mpv do that 
but it's only when there's weirdness with ffmpeg 
nah its in the encode itself 
Meh, not surprising 
Don't have high expectations for the show in the first place 
WizBright 
Liseda 
hi 
what's a good GTK theme 
i've always used FlatStudioLight because its.. like super simple and flat 
tbh idr 
when I was ricing GTK stuffs tho 
I used Numix Blue stuff 
Flattr icons 
numix light isn't free though D: 
did you vote yet 
Just did 
Ayy Hibike #1 
the code geass OVA was leading somehow in the start 
lol 
Jesus 
I think I watched one of those OVas for the lulz 
Not wasting any more of my time 
the first one was awful 
All I remember was shittons of CGI 
blowing lots of shit up/mecha battles 
and some ridiculous plot 
Which I'm better off having forgotten 
Liseda: I like t3k 
It looks beat for my setup 
Sweet jesus 
I hate writing Makefiles 
This is such dumb shit 
thinking of changing server location Luminarys 
starting to get kinda bored of the shitty peering with hetzner :( 
Tbh 
the only good cheapish host is Leaseweb 
Good support desk, tons of customization options etc. 
wtf Luminarys 
i'm reporting u 
no double accounts allowed for AB 
My favorite anime on rank 1 is Sword art Online. It was my first anime in my whole life and at the same time the best time in my life. In this small period I illustrated the relationship between Asuna and Kirito on my own life. Especially I see Kirito as me. 
Dafuq? 
lol 
Who's profile is this? 
Sounds like my doppelganger >.> 
mine obviously 
lmao 
Sounds like someone from mal 
writing a review of their favorite anime 
Because that's what 95% of the reviews on that site are

what is up with the fist bumps 
is this a bro show now （ ´_ゝ`） 
also Liseda did you decide on a theme? 
Can females not be bros? 
I dun get it 
they can 
but what is this nippon bro fist 
Glorious 
You really need to use a bouncer dude 
WizBright, nah 
using the same theme 
I do 
but 
the DC is being a shit 
it seems 
so 
I may ask to move soon 
also 
DC? 
or DO 
I might modify one called Arc to be square and pink instead of blue 
Data Center 
link to arc? 
also you and pink? 
it seems to soft for you :^) 
ttoo* 
You use a colo? 
too* 
I have virtual private servers 
mmm 
Liseda: it's actually kinda neat 
what is 
this mpv-livetweet 
oh 
i wnated to do something similar 
but from kodi 
kodi? 
xbmc 
ahh 
and 
you asked after arc 
dunno if i like it enough th ough 
i'll just switch back to flatstudiolight lol 
Arc looks neat 
but too light x.x 
yeah 
i like light though 
it has a bit too much padding for my taste 
but i like the lines 
yee 
I'm checking out flatstudiolight now 
flatstudiodark is nice 
I'mma use it now :o 
death to dark colours 
i'd use dark ones if i had an OLED monitor lol 
pls 
you have light like my soul 
can you even get oled monitors 
I have dark like your soul 
only problem is my sf breaks onto another line now （ ´_ゝ`） 
sf? 
screenfetch 
lol 
incirease the window? 
hm nope 
can't find any OLED monitors 
i guess they have issues with ghosting or something 
there is this bug with flatstudiolight though 
lol i found an OLED monitor 
25" 
just $6,899.99 
good find 
what bug lissy? 
if you scroll 
there is this overscroll-effect 
kinda like a curve colour thingy 
its usually quite transparent 
but it is like full colour on this theme 
and it just becomes completely gray while scrolling and blocking the content 
lol 
i fixed the overshoot-thingy in the theme WizBright 
so i was on my way 
modifying the arc theme 
shit loads of stuffs are images though 
ugh 
i guess i could batch recolour images with imagemagick D: 
Oh god modifying gtk themes 
That sound slike alot of not fun 
Liseda is best girl 
I took a great nap 
after all those overnights 
overnights huh 
ye 
WizBright, https://eru.me/i/Vxu 
scaling shit is fucking awful 
one thing is out of size and i don't even get why

very lame 
He names everythign after himself 
It's hilarious 
Well not everything, but alot of stuff 
i'm currently making a kancolle client 
with stuff i've never actually used before 
Oh neat 
Do they have an API? 
so i feel hipster as fuck 
they kinda do 
but its not a "real" api 
japanese developers fucking suck 
so its a flash game that calls the api 
its not an api for other peoples use 
i heard they have banned people for refreshing the game too much and other stuff 
So you're using the flash game as a proxy 
yeah i'm basically running a wrapper around the flash game 
intercepting the api calls 
Naice 
most kancolle clients do something similar but they aren't really cross-platform 
I assume you're making a Linux port 
so i'm using electron, node.js and other stuff 
Or not 
So it's an alternative web client? 
i kinda wanted to make it in Go/Rust/Python first 
but literally nothing has mature enough bindings for webviews that has flash support 
and it kinda makes sense 
because who the fuck wants to use flash in 2015? 
No one sane 
That's for sure 
so it boiled down to python because QT had support for plugins 
but it wasn't really modern enough and it wasn't really updated 
I wouldn't really use python for anything gui tbh 
Well wouldn't want to 
yeah, thats anothe rreason 
In general GUI stuff sucks 
releasing applications as python is awful 
And yea I agree 
and because my goal was cross-platform, having someone else handling the whole porting stuff (github is doing Electron) 
Also the 2/3 stuff is dumb 
looked to be the best solution 
they use the same stuff for their editor Atom 
i don't really like Atom that much but the base is surprisingly solid 
Interesting 
makes you able to do applications in js/html/css that feels native which is cool 
i don't really like javascript myself but its better than nothing 
Oh it's one of these chromium based things 
yeah 
Neat 
Wait so will the port require flash in browser? 
Well I guess it has to require flash at some level if you're interacting with the flash client 
it requires only the new modern flash that still gets updates and patched 
the pppapi pepperflash plugin 
Right 
but it can get it seperatly or use it if you have chromium/chrome installed 
obviously i'd want to skip whole flash but it doesn't seem reasonable to "port" a whole game 
Sure 
a friend of mine is actually doing lab software 
for use in labs and stuff 
Oh lol 
can't really talk more specific because muh NDA and he's competing with billionaire companies 
I've worked in labs alot 
All that stuff runs on XP 
but he uses electron himself and his company is starting to gain ground shitloads 
Well at least in terms of the equipment I'm exposed to 
yea, we're talking about bleeding edge stuff though 
Ah 
probably going to get some big company sending assassins after him if he steals more consumers tbh

Dude, everyone developing watches anime

I'm going to say, I stole the .cute feature from SirCmpwn's irc bots which do somethign similar 
more like everyone on 4chan watches anime m8 
lol 
I think that's /g/'s favorite thing to debate about besides the usual consumerist stuff 
The first 50 /dpt/ posts are almost guarnteed to be "Thank you for using an anime image" "Please use an anime image next time" "Fuck off weebs" or something along those lines 
Luminarys: you forked sway 3 times? :o 
I forked it ALOT 
Because I kept on having to delete my forks 
You can't really roll back stuff on github 
rip 
So whenever there's some kind of conflict, I just delete and refork 
lol 
I dunno why I've had to do it so much for this particular project 
how does your desktop look with sway? 
Not using it right now 
Not enough features 
Also it's very buggy on multiple monitors atm 
Works pretty decently on a single monitor though

he's missing a lot of points though 
new games will 100% never work in wine 
pretty sure they don't have any plans at all to port dx11 and higher to wine 
not even dx10 works yet 
and they said they were planning that for yeaaaaaars 
He says >New games won't work in wine 
Ok I see your point 
If it never catches up 
he says the installer will walk you through the process with linux too 
but most distros with graphical installers are mostly poop 
pretty much only ubuntu that i've had "flawless" success with the graphical installation 
Hmm, they seemed decent when I used them 
Actually, if anything Windows caused real problems with its graphical isntaller 
that too 
windows one is total poop 
Last time I was putting dual boot on my comp 
like, if your installation media is GPT you can't install in MBR or the opposite 
so dumb 
It was like "This partition is no good" 
So I reformatted, whatever 
"This partition is still no good" 
Go into cmd and try doing it manually 
"This partition is still no good"

woops 
why not 
you're just bad

tfw I am setting up thing for images 
can't find /www/ folder 
images? 
tfw can't even nginx 
sudo pacman -S nginx 
sudo systemctl start nginx 
(it's a debian 7 server) 
Ah ok 
The sudo apt-get install nginx 
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start 
then* 
Then vim(or nano) /etc/nginx/nginx.conf 
Modify stuff so that everything is configured properly 
sudo nginx -s reload 
I just need to setup a folder for images 
Ok this is simple 
and then let it be readable from nginx 
Do you have a hostname for your server? 
Yea I know what you want 
:^) 
yes I do 
plsnotice.me 
:^) 
Noice 
Ok so basically 
I recommend doing 
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/plsnotice/senpai 
Hmm 
Can you tell me if there's a sites-enabled/sites-available dir in /etc/nginx? 
both 
er 
yeah both 
Ok cool 
in sites-available 
vim/nano plsnoticeme-pics 
In that add in 
:D 
ttp://pastebin.com/Lxv18RM5 
Link Title: server { listen 80; server_name plsnotice.me; root /var/www/plsno - Pastebin.com 
To briefly explain 
You're declaring a server block 
Which is basically a vhost 
If you use apache 
That's basically a domain/subdomain 
Well it is a domain/subdomain 
So server_name is the name that nginx checks for 
root sets the root location where nginx will look 
So when you go to plsnotice.me, nginx looks in /var/www/plsnotice/ initiailly for stuff like index.html etc. 
location block means you're providing details for a specific location 
That location being /senpai 
And in that block autoindex on; is used 
Which means that nginx will look for and display all files 
Also, quick thing to make this better 
sudo mkdir /var/www/plsnotice/pictures 
sudo mv /var/www/plsnotice/senpai /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/ 
then in the config 
change root to /var/www/plsnotice/pictures 
THis is a more sane way of doing it because it means you can easily organize by domain 
is should be /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/ 
with an ending / eh? 
Ending doesn't matter 
o 
If you like it w/ending then add it 
If not, then you don't need it 
tell me when done 
I am done 
ok 
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled 
mkay 
sudo ln -s ../sites-available/plsnoticeme-pics . 
include all of it? 
even the ending . 
yea 
or is that a typo 
ok 
restart nginx? 
Basically the purpose of doing things like this is that nginx is set to look for vhosts in sites-enabled 
I assume 
Yea 
But by keeping sites in sites-available 
and symlinking them into sites-enabled 
You can have sites not in use that you can easily re-enable 
> $ sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart 
Restarting nginx: nginx: [emerg] directive "root" is not terminated by ";" in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/plsnoticeme-pics:5 
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test failed 
Oops,f rogot the ; 
Just add that and try again 
so ~/pictures/; 
lol 
Err no 
ok 
where are your pictures 
no I mean 
in the server block 
add it to the root line 
Yes, end with ; 
If by tilde you were contracting, that's fine 
I thoguht you were setting it to ~/pictures/; 
Which is bad 
I just didn't want to type out all the other crap :< 
~ is confusing because it's a common subsitution 
.../ is prob better 
anyways 
woo 
ttp://plsnotice.me/senpai/ 
it works 
time to setup everything now 
Link Title: Index of /senpai/ 
Fuck 
Yea 
do you have pictures in a directory? 
not on the server atm 
Ah ok 
Then yea, just put stuff in senpai and it'll be good 
I guess you should rsync stuff in 
I believe there is a way to have it so it's hidden from prying eyes 
but I could still link 
autoindex off; ? 
Do you want to password protect this? 
If you do that, it just stops the visual display 
o 
I just want to be able to link say to you 
people could still access plsnotice.me/senpai/lewdpicture1.jpg 
If they know the file name 
and then if you decide to go to the root picture 
s/picture/directory/ 
WizBright: and then if you decide to go to the root directory 
I'd see everything 
it wouldn't show all of it 
Do you want them to see everything or not? 
I guess no 
no 
Ok, then yea turn autoindex off; 
2lewd4u underage boy 
>.> 
but it will still link ok? 
Yep 
autoindex just shows files 
time to symlink 
Do you have one direcotry on the server with all the pictures? 
If so 
sudo rmdir /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/senpai 
cd /var/www/plsnotice/pictures 
sudo ln -s /location/of/your/pic-folder/ . 
s/./senpai/ 
Luminarys: sudo ln -s /location/of/your/pic-folder/ senpai 
I was just wanting to make it so it was in my home folder 
and linked to pic folder 
Yea just do that then 
so if it's /home/wizbright/lewdpics 
sudo ln -s /home/wizbright/lewdpics /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/senpai 
Or if in /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/ 
sudo ln -s /home/wizbright/lewdpics senpai 
sudo ln -s /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/senpai . 
I just did that 
so when I sftp pics 
it'll go straight in the folder 
The thing about this is it adds an extra directory to your name 
And that looks ugly 
It's better to remove the senpai dir 
and replace it with the symlink 
no 
it adds more effect 
plsnotice.me/senpai/ 
Just need to make each upload in unix time now 
You want plsnotice.me/senpai/lewdpictures/picture1.jpg 
or 
You want plsnotice.me/senpai/picture1.jpg 
^ 
Yes, then you'd have to do this 
sudo rmdir /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/senpai 
sudo ln -s /home/wizbright/lewdpics /var/www/plsnotice/pictures/senpai 
I never created a lewdpics directory though （ ´_ゝ`） 
Yea, use whatever picture directory you want to 
Well make the directory for pictures, then do the command 
I just symlinked 
tbh WizBright, you should just run a private file hosting site >.>

I'll get it down

tfw chmod is so foreign to me 
lol 
See you can do all that with keybinds 
And it's wayyy faster 
How are you trying to upload 
Also you should rsync 
sftp 
Eww, use rsync 
Well it depends 
>>not supported with my shitty screencloud 
are you trying to move alot of photos? 
no I am just wanting to use it as a screenshotter 
and have it host the images 
that's all 
Plz use scrot and keybinds 
It will make your life easier down the line 
I'll just chmod the directory on my own （ ´_ゝ`） 
Ok so where you sending sftp to? 
Well what dir? 
yep 
chmod 744 ~/senpai ? 
If you own it, it shouldn't be an issue >.> 
I don't think the execute bit is necessary 
Like 
644 
Are you trying to sync a bunch of photos in a pictures? 
In a directory* 
bleh 
no 
Just uploading single photos 
Do you know where the photos are? 
well 
I will be sftping them to the server 
into that directory 
so I need to set perms on it 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Sure, but on your actual computer 
do you know where the photos are? 
yes? 
Do you know the filenames of the stuff you want to send 
it'll create all that with the screenshot. 
Ah ok 
So you don't have files 
but you want to make it so that you can easily upload, right? 
yep 
I hit keybind, takes screenshot 
then uploads 
Yes, you should do that, but with scrot 
it's just the perms for the directory that is causing issues.. 
m8 
I have scrot 
I like how this app has options for full screen or selection 
Ok then bind this 
so does scrot 
scrot -s 
tfw no sftp script for images 
But the basic command for scrot is 
and this will upload too 
Do you have an ssh key 
Well rather 
can you ssh into your server w/out password? 
yes 
I have had that setup 
that's why I was doing sftp as it was easy 
scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h_scrot.png' -e 'scp $f wizbright@plsnotice.me:/home/wizbright/Pictures/$f && mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots' 
change /home/wizbright/Pictures to the full path of the directory where you want the file to be 
Basically that takes a screenshot, executes scp to upload it to your server, then moves it to ~/Pictures/Screenshots/ 
Assuming ~/Pictures/Screenshots is a valid dir 
It's simple :^) 
I did this from just reading the scrot and scp man pages 
scrot is saving all my images in the home directory 
hmm 
the mv should fix that 
scrot default saves to location you're in 
idk 
I'll mess with it later 
"easy" 
I was just wanting to fix the perms so I had something usuable 
I'll deal with scrot later 
Extremely :^) 
The command looks long 
But that's mostly from file names 
Again, I copied most of these from manual pages 
I know 
but I am just getting frustrated 
and I want screencloud shit to work 
JUST SO I CAN HAVE SOMETHING 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
It seems odd that it isn't 
Expand all tildes 
no 
for screencloud 
Yea for screencloud 
still giving me file permission errors 
Plz just try my command >.> 
I did 
couldn't find the file 
so I am moving on to this 
What's the error? 
It's likely that you didn't properly specify a dir 
wiz@Bebop ~ » scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h_scrot.png' -e 'scp $f wiz@plsnotice.me:/home/wiz/Pictures/$f && mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots' 
scp: /home/wiz/Pictures/2015-08-15_1366x768_scrot.png: No such file or directory 
ok 
does /home/wiz/Pictures exist on the server? 
Like as a directory 
nope 
That's your problem :D 
Then try it again and it'll work like a charm 
Well make it then try again 
wiz@Bebop ~ » scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h_scrot.png' -e 'scp $f wiz@plsnotice.me:/home/wiz/senpai/$f && mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots' 
scp: /home/wiz/senpai/2015-08-16_1366x768_scrot.png: Permission denied 
you were saying :^) 
does /home/wiz/senpai exist? 
>.> 
yes 
wait 
hmm 
just a sec, lemme test something 
yeah I can't even access the directory 
from my own shell 
oh 
lelel 
THen that's the issue 
yep 
in server 
chmod pls help 
sudo chown wiz /home/wiz/senpai 
sudo chmod 755 /home/wiz/senpai 
or no 
just chmod 755 /home/wiz/senpai 
well it uploaded 
:D 
Did the mv fail? 
but not like it copies link to clipboard 
no errors so 
It will if you don't have ~/Pictures/Screenshots 
yea ok 
Oh you want the link 
That's pretty easy too 
Also, did you test the file 
Or rather that it's accesible from the server? 
Ok it does 
Ok to get the link 
Yea I already got it 
Ok while I muck around with xsel 
scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h_scrot.png' -e 'scp $f wizbright@plsnotice.me:/home/wizbright/Pictures/$f && mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots && echo "http://plsnotice.me/senpai/$f"' 
Link Title: 403 Forbidden 
That'll print out the url 
So many chans >.> 
I guess I'll have to make a script that would use xclip or something to copy to clipboard 
Also that dock 
Plz send help 
Testing it 
LIke you should be able toa dd 
to add* 
echo "...." | xsel -i 
But for some reason it isn't copying to my clipboard 
Weird, I guess it kinda works 
It just dones't want to paste into my webbrowser 
Just add on that pipe to the end 
See if it works 
it does 
woo 
This is pretty simple, so just modify it as you please 
I recommend either binding it to a key in your WM/DE 
Or making an alias 
Also make an alias using scrot -s 
That way you can do a selection upload 
See, the advantage of this over that screenshot service you were using is that it's much more extensible 
Also you can customize it alot more 
I think I'd recommend writing a script which accepts a filename from stdin and runs these commands 
That way you don't have to make some dumb longass chain of &&s 
hmm for some reason my keybinds aren't working 
it works when I use a prompt 
but not when I try to make it run outside of one 
move it to a script 
o 
ok 
LIke 
How are you doing keybinds? 
as soon as you reminded me of that I was good 
lol 
to bad it doesn't let me know when it's done lol 
? 
also still not working some reason （ ´_ゝ`） 
Ok, I'll write you a quick shell script :D 
I made the keybind execute bash /home/wiz/.scripts/scrott.sh 
Ok that should work 
Does executing it yourself work? 
ash /home/wiz/.scripts/scrott.sh 
eh 
it doesn't spit out anything 
Oh wait 
did you chmod +x the script? 
but it doesn't do the link 
You can't run scripts on your computer unless they have the execute bit 
I did that 
still 
Err 
Remove the | xsel -i 
it works 
it's just not copying to clipboard 
Ah 
I use xclip 
so i'm sure I could use that? 
Oh possibly 
just do | xclip 
nope 
no dice 
hmmm 
Well 
try 
xsel -i -b at the end 
then if Ctrl + V doesn't patse 
Use Shift + ins 
ayy 
Naice 
what does the -b mean? 
It's the clipboard you're using 
there's three, PRIMARY, SECONDARY, and CLIPBOARD 
By default xsel uses PRIMARY 
But -b sets it to use CLIPBOARD 
And it looks like that works 
Also that dock really triggers me >.> 
now it's just trying to make it work with keybinds 
good 
You meany 
trigger away 
Torturing my eyes like this should be a crime >.> 
running from keybind doesn't make it work （ ´_ゝ`） 
Is it even running? 
I don't see why not? 
Just test 
rm ~/Pictures/Screenshots/* 
Then run keybind 
see if anything is in ~/Pictures/Screenshots 
there is no ~/pictures/screenshots 
Err 
Where is the script moving the pictures to? 
or it does 
but I don't see it 
Does ~/Pictures/Screenshots as a directory? 
Or is it the image 
Because it might be the image 
it's an image I guess 
rm it 
but It says I can't create it 
mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots 
yeah it's failing to make anything 
Erm 
rm ~/Pictures/Screenshots 
mkdir ~/Pictures/Screenshots 
Then see if script creates image 
nope 
Hmm 
Change script such that mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots is mv $f ~/Pictures/Screenshots/$f 
Then see if you get the screen shot in there 
I just changed the bindings 
but not the screenshots will save on my side 
Wut? 
well 
it seems the bindings weren't activating 
lel 
Use a better WM 
Or a proper key listening daemon 
it was looking for Alt + ! 
when I did alt + shift + 1 
kek 
so I switched it to alt + shift + z 
and it worked 
weird 
Naice 
Well, there ya go 
everything works! 
Naice naice 
slop and maim > scrot 
i use slop for selecting what to video record and other shit 
and it plays nice with compton which every other tool doesn't 
Oh yea, I've used maim in the past, it does some nice stuff 
Wait, this actually does seem much nicer than scrot 
Time to rewrite my aliases >.> 
thanks Luminarys （ ´_ゝ`） 
? 
>made me all this scrot stuff 
>realizes maim is better

Naice 
I need more goblins for my deck 
like two goblin piledrivers （ ´_ゝ`） 
I should fix my scripts to work with slop and maim now （ ´_ゝ`） 
It ain't hard ;D 
well I don't know where to start 
I can't seem to pass the image to the server 
because maim won't let me execute code after I screenshot 
or I am just shit so 
Yea, I don't believe that maim allows for -e 
What it does do is pass the filename to stdout iirc 
yep 
$ maim ~/$(date +%F-%T).png 
From the man page 
So if you do that and like echo $(....) | myscript.sh 
And read from stdin 
You can then process the file like such 
Or just do a oneliner 
That works too 
i just mount my server as sshfs 
so i'm always connected for speedy uploads 
lol 
I'll just stick with scrot I guess 
I like sshfs for some stuff 
what 
lol 
I can't figure it out. 
pls WizBright 
pls 
what are you trying to do 
Effart m8 
make a script 
m8 
Google: "How to read in variables from stdin" 
I had to listen/talk about paint all day 
Then just perform all actions on that var 
plus drive home in rush hour, in the rain 
The rain was no fun >.> 
If you don't know how to use vars, look that up too 
Everything else, you can just use from the script I gave you 
I don't know how to script at all 
er bash script 
There is no real knowledge necessary 
yes 
but 
just tell us 
what you're trying to do 
He's trying to repurpose the scrot script I gave him to work w/maim 
no I wanna do it 
and be a shit 
Then do it 
Google or just ask us >.> 
what does your current script do WizBright 
Takes picture, scp's it to his server, moves it to a dir 
it errors out and calls me a shit 
"echo "WizBright a shit" 
what do you name your image files 
He's just using the default scrot time/res name scheme 
I was wanting to use unix time but idk 
I doubt he cares 
Unix time is prob fine 
I like it better than other naming schemes 
just 
start the bash script by defining the name 
the plan is to make it execute from a keybind 
yes but you'll just call that script from the keybind 
something lazy like 
picture='date +%s' 
maim ~/$picture.png 
i mean 
you can understand where i'm goingi 
ya 
you just have to look up how your DE handles keybindings 
I was having an issue passing the variable 
Then just run your scp, file moving 
What's your script look like? 
my script is super ugly 
Talking to WizBright >.> 
i know 
was just talking lol 
Well, when it comes to script, function over form tbh 
Unless you're sharing them 
Then you should prob consider both 
echo "https://eru.me/$location/$name" | xclip -selection clipboard > /dev/null 
Link Title: eru.me 
echo "https://eru.me/$location/$name" | xclip -selection primary > /dev/null 
Link Title: eru.me 
hue 
super hardcore 
Nice 404 :D 
well that doesnt exist omg! 
lol 
thats just how my sloppy unique name looks like 
it works, thats what matters 
ik 
idk what the %thingy is for unixtime （ ´_ゝ`） 
i linked it 
lol 
picture='date +%s' 
well 
that broke on me 
oh wait 
Have to run it in a shell, right? 
yep 
Well sub shell 
Or whatever you wanna call it 
or it will just say "date +%s" 
Gotta capture dat stdout 
well 
it hates me 
why 
do you have 
#!/bin/bash 
in the start 
take a pic how it looks 
Link Title: cxg.de - Code Exchange 
All those $f's lol 
Well just one 
But yea, replace it with $picture 
It looks pretty decent to me tbh 
can i say something completely unrelated? 
sure. 
you should turn off those icons 
lol 
it would look p nice 
I had them off 
idk why I put them back 
fixed. 
dunno, your script works for me 
lol 
well it doesn't work for me I guess. 
are you sure you even have maim installed 
yep 
pretty sure 
if you replace $picture 
with just test 
does it work 
are you sure 
that you actually want to just move $picture 
you should probably set the full directory 
from home, at least 
same error still 
try 
actually nvm 
rip me 
Luminarys: for archive manga 
? 
should I have it extract to the current folder and just read it from there? 
Oh, sure 
Just make sure that it's a directory 
With pictures 
not archived or anything 
It defaults to current directory 
Ye, then cd in 
I just need to grab the directory I dump them in 
I'm trying to see how I can dump to a folder 
Use unzip/unrar/tar? 
I was even thinking about dumping it to a mkstemp thing 
I am using shutil to dump 
Ah ok 
or do you have another way in mind? 
Since you don't have a proper GUI, I don't think it's a terrible idea or anything 
Well GUI or TUI 
But once you do, you'd want to give them more control 
mkay 
well 
it works 
I was able to dump a zip file into a temp directory

i'm feeling american today 
i bought ONE donut!! 
WOW!! 
Hey, at least the guy sounds like he knows a little bit of Japanese 
did you know 
they sell them by the dozen?? 
what 
It's a slippery slope tsunderella 
really? 
12 pack? 
a WHOLE dozen!! 
lol 
welll these are badly storemade donuts 
storemade 
wtf does that mean 
BAD ones 
i dunno 
as opposed to fried by your mother?? 
yeah???? 
no but 
these are the kind 
that are sent FROZEN to the store 
oh what 
Gross 
its not good donuts 
we dont even have those 
ofc you have 
you just have them in like walmart 
in a corner 
or something 
we have some that Wonder makes and ship them by the bag but they're fresh 
I'm psure we don't 
The ones in America are packed full of preservatives 
oh 
That way they don't need to waste money keeping them cold 
right 
I'm in the same district as a Wonder factory too so that also helps 
I've honestly never seen freozen donuts in a store 
You see the room temp fake stuff all the time tho 
yeah that sounds weird 
well they are frozen when they are sent to the store but they heat up while in the store 
you don't actually buy them frozen 
Oh 
Well, I have no idea then 
if you buy them super early 
when they just recently opened 
they might be still frozen 
But if they do cool them, it's likely only a little bit 
well theyre not frozen but maybe transported in a refridgerated truck 
^ 
I'm no expert 
Ye, just enough to keep them from melting 
I used to live next to this donut espresso shop 
that I could walk to 
there is a good donut shop in the middle of the city i live in 
but i have never been there 
you could smell the fresh donuts every morning 
I miss that place 
That seems nice 
lol 
when I was doing stage crew I would get a coffee from them every morning 
i NEVER buy fastfood or food like that 
never bought a coffee like that either 
:| 
rip... 
not american enough 
even eating fake donuts 
nice job, poser 
a coffee at a coffee shop is like fucking $8 here 
i'm broke m8 
lol 
you can just 
buy a bag of beans 
and a press 
well yeah 
make some good coffee yourself 
thats why i don't buy stuff in shops 
duh!!! 
or cafés rather 
tee hee 
Making your own coffee is easy 
Just buy a French Press 
it's easy 
Insta good coffee 
but it's also easy to do it wrong 
Not really tbh 
You just need press, boiling water, ground up beans, and the filter 
And a cup obviously 
I had a friend copy what I did with the press 
but he used a blade grinder 
lol 
how can you fail a press 
what 
Exactly 
that made it into this this ass powder shit 
I have no idea 
kek 
lol 
so it goes straight through the filter 
Best thing is to buy it preground tbh 
i have that 
i'm not really a coffee expert yet so i dunno what coffee i like the most so far 
so i just buy something 
Or grind it in the store you buy it 
yeah if you plan on drinking it within the next two weeks 
I'm not coffee expert either 
I barely drink coffee for that matter >.> 
doesnt stay fresh enough and you have no control of the extraction 
I dunno 
Keeping ground beans frozen has works well enough I think 
oor maybe do it like bo1g instead 
just drink soda 24/7

lol 
probably a premade quiz/survey system 
auto shuffles answers 
I would much rather complain about that shitty url 
The thing is, some of the questions were properly ordered 
wtf are they doing 
Oh that's intentional 
wow I can change the colors of a FILE UPLOADER 
Ebin :^) 
It means you can send links to a shortened URL but still preserve original name 
file uploaders are rocket science 
:D 
I know your secrets

17:27:10<@bo1g> that's pretty neat

Papers please is fun 
I havent finished it actually

No you're right 
Oh phew ok 
I thought you were gonna have me typeset

Mild social panic for a second there 
You're fine ( ´Д｀)ﾉ(´･ω･`) 
Oh you never gave me the script too 
I thought I sent you the first chapter from that volume >:(

I was adding a config for a domain for my new username 
was all 
and shit just fucking DIES 
rip 
I still have some credit with Digital Ocean 
I may have to renew my domain in a month or so 
gotta keep plsnotice.me 
if you want a sub domain let me know ;) 
heh thats a good one 
Link Title: riichi.me 
this is my dev site 
lol 
just have to wait for cloudflare to update nameservers now 
zzz 
oh its done 
neat 
cloudflare is pfast 
most of the time 
Link Title: Re-kyuu Senkan 
.co domains are $2.88 if anyone cares 
on namecheap 
Most domains are really cheap 
xyz is 1$ I think 
sounds lame tho 
like try saying that outloud 
ex why zee 
I just use com 
eww. 
It's the standard 
com too long 
I do agree tho 
kek 
io 
Though that's 30$ 
io was fuckin $30 
ye 
lol 
I have an io domain >.> 
first choice otherwise 
I think my .me was $12 too 
I might buy a .me domain one of these days 
Oh hey 
I remember I can get one for free through github 
is that part of the schooling thing 
Ye 
I have a .edu address even though I'm still in HS :D 
Oh hey, io domains are only 25 
I need a job 
shit sucks 
Such is life >.> 
Bleh, remakign my resume now 
I have to apply for colleges n shit 
oh that's fun 
I should apply for a Pell grant 
Extremely 
What's that? 
the scholarship that includes unemployment benefits 
essentially 
Interesting 
kinda why I changed my username on everything and killed off bo1g 
? 
thought there might be a SLIGHT CHANGE employers are seeing my weeb ass everywhere 
Oh 
searching for me after I apply 
chance** 
Do you think that would significantly decresae your chances of getting a job? 
I mean as long as you don't say on forums "I'm a lolicon" or something along those lines I don't see it as an issue tbh 
hasn't before but it's been more than a month and I havent gotten any calls so I'm trying everything at this point 
yeah nothing like that 
Fair enough 
but who knows 
my worst search result is a post from 2007 on microsoft forums asking people why my flash drive wasnt working 
That's pretty not cringy 
my google+ had a lot of public posts 
nothing BAD but lots of anime pics so I shut that down 
and because of that bo1g came up in the same results so I just reset everything 
lol 
Hmm, I don't think I've really posted anything particularly cringe worthy in all my time using things like forums 
all the forums I participated in have since shut down and they were from awhile ago anyway 
hahaha 
one of them has apparently reopened 
legendofzelda.com 
was my elementry - high school site 
I was a mod 
oh my god the same people are on ehre 
that's funny shit 
Naice 
I've never been interested enough in forums to get to that kind of level >.> 
there was an email a few years back saying it shut down 
I helped them with some theming stuff at the time 
then I started working so I had to stop 
:^( 
meh vbulletin theming was trash 
doesnt look like they improved either 
I would like to do freelancing 
just not sure how to get my name back out there 
I mean do you really need to get your name out there? 
Best way would probably be to make a popular open source project imo 
I've been wanting to make a weeb apples to apples 
that pulls cards from a database that users can update to 
been learning socket.io for that 
guess I could work on that 
This sounds like somethign I'd use Go for 
I try to avoid JS when I can >.> 
Websockets are cool tho 
I've really taken a liking to it 
after I learned it 
JS or websockets? 
or socket.io? 
js 
been using node 
Ah 
Well, each to his own 
go still has a way to go imo 
it's good on it's own 
no puns intended 
I can't bring myself to like weakly typed langs 
Yea, Go is still young 
But I'm using it in favor of Python now whenever I can 
I see go as more of a python replacement 
ye 
Ya 
It compiles fast enough that it's practically like a scripting language 
python has tornado but it's still a bit slower than js 
Go is alot simpler than python imo 
Also I greatly prefer their docs 
I tried making a kancollev viewer with Go but I couldnt get it to make API calls 
taht was two updates ago thou 
maybe more 
Yea, 1.5 came out recently 
Compile times increased by 2x :D 
It'll get better once they properly translate the autoconverted C->Go code 
I'd like to make a twitch bot with Go 
when I was in Maryland 
I had made a python bot 
to operate kancolle through the stream 
because I had Twitch access at work 
Naice 
lol 
the delay was meh but I was playing kancolle at work lol 
I had a py file that was just mouse coordinates 
like 1000 lines long 
:O 
I wrote that script so fast 
oh guess it was 500 
lol 
I had changed the layout 
That's still alot 
wait 
this isnt the latest one 
thats why it's short 
lol 
missing the sortie functions 
I do like python tbh 
just feels comfy 
Ye, it's nice 
Python is like the first language I used seriously 
Then I learned C, HTML/CSS/JS, PHP, SQL, and then Go 
I need to learn a functional language well >.> 
Also some ASM would be nice too 
I did HTML/CSS in high school when I handled their site 
then PHP after that doing some small projects for a few clients 
I'd say 
over the past couple years I've learned python 
and js over the past month lol 
I learned Java when I was pretty young 
most of what I really cared about is design stuff but I'm finally doing more of the harder stuff 
It's been like 6 years now 
oh I did try android dev 
that SUCKS 
Ye, I've made a few apps 
Made a couple hundred $ off of one 
I wanted to make a manga reader and I made a layout and quit lol 
I dislike development of anything with a GUI tbh 
wow dude 
what apps? 
Well, when I was younger I made a calculator for handling algebraic equations 
I was pretty young, didn't know anything about infix-postfix or anythign actaully interesting 
So used a bunch of jank string processing to try and derive order of operations 
I also had a weird sense of humor at the time 
heh 
So I'd have the calculator say "Use a valid equation you dumb &#!@" 
If there was any kind of weird syntax 
I would just mash keys 
Basically the kind of stuff you'd expect out of someone of my age tbh 
unless I was having a bad day 
Mmm 
These days I try not to do anything like that 
Both in terms of app dev and putting in dumb stuff 
lol 
like I said depends on the day 
guess I could start on that game 
I'm fuckin terrible with SQL 
Meh 
guess if it's just a card database I could use mongo 
It's not too hard to use at a basic level 
Just read a book on database design 
Don't do dumb thigns like CSV columns 
lmao 
I actually thought that might be a good idea when I started with SQL 
Had no idea what a foreign key was at the time to be fair 
yeah learned about that shit during a Django project 
Naice 
I actually have that up 
right now 
Django has nice ORM 
for my portfolio 
Link Title: Kill la Kill - sasami.us 
You did this? 
before hummingbird became relevant I tried replacing MAL 
ye 
liseda helped some 
This looks nicer than hummingbird tbh 
I had this and user accounts working but had a hard time figuring out lists 
Yea this sounds like not fun 
kinda wanted a 'no bullshit' list 
Big messy diagrams >.> 
like the CONNECT TO FACEBOOK or COMMUNITIES 
and MAL is hilariously outdated 
Yeee 
I dont know for sure but I'm guessing hummingbird is Ruby 
feels slow as fuck sometimes 
It is 
lol 
HA 
It's Rails 
As you might imagine 
tried learning that too 
worst mistake ever 
I mean we have nuck here, he's a lead dev 
For hummingbird that is 
kek 
I might learn Ruby one of these days 
I'm probably just going to learn Erlang and use Elixir if I want Rails type web apps tho 
I thought about picking this up again too 
same thing, just a no bullshit list 
That seems like much more fun than Rails tbh 
I like this idea 
cause I use hummingbird for is Taiga anyway 
I like Hummingbird 
Dislike the blog type stuff 
exactly 
Just want a nice simple list 
the other thing 
which liseda was helping with at the time 
was scraping shows 
Ah 
or populating the database 
Ye, gotta get dat shit into a JSON 
Then turn that into SQL stuffs 
aniDB had an anti scraping clause or something 
MAL was a mess 
lol 
I think we tried anilist? dont remember 
you can tell the scraped from MAL because ID's were the same 
there's just 
so much 
anime > characters, seiyuus / staff / music 
subbers 
studios 
Yea 
air dates 
its ROUGH 
Gigabytes I imagine 
THIS might work in Go 
with that 
Rougher on whatever server you use 
martini 
or whatever 
Eh 
I use a super lightweight web framework for Go 
what one is that 
It just has regex matching for URLs and that's it 
Web.go 
Well it has a little more than that 
Gives you a few nice things built in 
Lets you do your own middleware 
But it's basically just a wrapper 
Link Title: hoisie/web · GitHub 
oh this is nice 
I initially used it because it was the only thing that worked and had decent docs 
Also I prefer simplicity because it means you have to learn less :D 
I learned after I used Flask that web/databases are just a series of gets and posts 
Yeaaa 
I always thought it was more complicated 
Once I started doing serious web dev 
mostly thanks to Django 
I realized how everythign worked 
Like you never think about how everything is in a DB until you actually make stuff yourself 
exactly 
reason I've taken a liking to node 
is because the design process is fuckin easy 
I realized a whole lot of stuff about how the web since I started my job doing web dev 
Oh really? 
with gulp and jade and sass 
In what way? 
one sec I got a repo 
Link Title: bo1g/gulp-webdev · GitHub 
I just run gulp 
and edit files 
and it updates for me 
So this is your boilerplate? 
Sass allows nesting and variables 
yeah for exporting to static 
I have another that uses Jade templating instead 
My "boilerplating" is just insert bootstrap and it just werks 
lmao 
I used 
bootstrap 
once for that anime site I showed you 
then I used Semantic 
Latter was better? 
then I realized both are terrible ideas and I should do things myself 
kek 
so for awhile I used skeleton which used to be just a grid 
I don't into HTML/CSS 
but lately they added buttons and colors and ehhh 
So I go the lazy way 
I've found I like to have control of everything 
Link Title: bo1g/simple-grid-sass · GitHub 
I do to 
this is my grid 
But sometimes, it just ain't worth it for me 
To be fair 
i've enver tried my hand at it either 
Interesting 
sure bootstrap can make things faster 
but it also looks like a lot of other sites thinking the same thing 
Yep 
It's so easy to pick out bootstrap using websites 
frameworks like bootstrap are huge too 
Ye 
lots of deps 
I've never looked at the actualy size 
actual* 
it's between that and how many files there are 
I've seen frameworks with 20+ css files 
like jesus we're not developing facebook here 
like that image uploader you posted the other day 
was using materialize 
:D 
Link Title: materialize/sass/components at master · Dogfalo/materialize · GitHub 
jesus 
It's material design, it must be good :^) 
lmao 
Well, I had no say in how that front end was made 
I will say I'm a fan of flat 
but JESUS 
started doing away with rounded corners too but that's personal preference 
Mmm 
I prefer non rounded too 
But yea it's finicky 
think I'll try doing apples to apples 
gotta get a UI first 
I'll call it ringo ni ringo 
Naice

I didn't have a seedbox before and yeah I plan to do that 
plus ab stuff 
all that 2hu 
Make sure you setup stuff properly 
Plz, WCD has way more stuff than AB 
Like 
I mean stuff from AB that isn't on WCD 
which is some stuff tbh 
SEtup a script to auto transcode FLACS to the other 3 formats, and create torrents which get added to your bittorrent client 
Then you just have to find the initial FLAC albums and you can just fill out info while your server does alot of the tedious stuff 
ye 
I just didn't know how to do mktorrent 
but I found some good stuff on WCD for it 
Ye

paint it?? 
probably cheaper 
and better looking 
get dat eggshell finish

painting will be harder i think 
and its not like painting isn't expensive either 
its around the same price

it's p nice 
You mean that rip off font 
I'm psure that the guy took some font, and just changed 5 chars >.> 
This is switching between DejaVu sans mono and Hack 
lo 
l 
kinda lame to call it a "whole new font" 
when its just a fork with super minor edits 
and their site is so fucking lame 
feels like they think they are superior as hell just because they forked someone elses work 
Either way, they're being disengenuous 
well, after all 
I'm pretty happy with my bitmap fonts >.> 
it allows forking 
technically they aren't doing anything wrong hoho 
can you rip something off that's open source tho 
exactly 
exactly 
exactly 
no 
but saying its something NEW is p lame 
oh 
sure 
still a nice font 
I like the @ symbols 
@@@@ 
:3 
lame.. 
ur lame 
l@me 
Again, it's not that what they're doing is somehow "illegal" 
But it's disengenuous for them to claim this is some kind of incredible creative feat 
And give minimal recognition to the original 
Hack has deep roots in the libre, open source typeface community and includes the contributions of the Bitstream Vera & DejaVu projects 
>deep roots 
you don't say hehehehehe 
ye, it's that stuff that bugs me

whats up with americans and carpet floor.. 
I hate it

i have weed floros too

wood floors

I'm trying to get him to fall for memes, but I don't think it's working 
yeah I'm lost now 
this is some shit I'd find on a cringe subreddit 
Yep 
I'm glad that we could spend this time together lumi 
I mean chat is like this 50% of the time 
Indeed bo1g 
m'lumi 
kek 
pls 
I am adult 
also what did I miss in main chan 
Alot 
Basically scj643 is acting immature as usual 
I see 
It was really cringe worthy prev. 
there is an actual underate rule though isn't there 
I don't remember 
There is 
or is he just pretending

New Shokugeki chapter (*￣▽￣*) 
havent read that since 
uh 
The anime seemed like ecchi crap 
I dont even remember 
Luminarys: watch it 
yeah the manga was a lot better 
it's decent 
mango is better 
I watched episode 1 
Erina is best girl 
not what I expected at all 
pls bug 
Perhaps I will 
watch more BUG 
yeah the manga has its lewd parts but the show was overkill 
as if JC Staff doesnt know how to fill time other than making dumb scenes longer 
The mango has a guy who does hentai on the side I thought 
remember that shit in Railgun where touma is just talking on the bridge for two straight episodes 
fuckin JC Staff 
Never watched it 
:^) 
dont bother 
Yea, Railgun is pretty crappy 
Well railgun and index 
LN's aren't too bad 
I'd say Railgun S was decent 
railgun is much better than index 
because the mc isn't total trash 
though it has moments 
where I'm like UGH 
Touma is pretty funny 
I think I dropped S actually 
The punch just werks 
after they finished with the sisters arc 
Second arc of S was terrible 
Sisters arc was neat 
Better version of the Index PoV imo 
and they didn't drag out the bridge in railgun either 
Mmm 
Man, I watched that over a year and a half ago 
Time flies >.> 
when it has it's SoL moments it's pretty cozy and fun, I don't mind the action and serious bits but it can be overdramatic and it can overstay it's welcome 
All the chuuni stuff was a bit of a turnoff 
I loved the OPs though 
I used to 
I listen to them now and I can't for some reason lol 
used to listen to fripside all the fuckin time 
I have a couple albums from them 
black bullet's op was fun too 
Late in autumn is great 
I just can't anymore 
feels too noisy 
kalafina is my top listened artist 
Kalafina is nice 
I'd post lastfm but scrobbles are still transferring 
Don't think I have any albums from her tho 
Just know her from the OPs I've heard 
them 
group of 3 
? 
3 OPs or 3 albums 
3 singers

Oh 
Ok, excuse the plebbery 
As stated, I only know the group name from some OPs

Possibly 
They have strict rules :< 
I would love you 5ever if you did.. 
Does WCD have a page listing stuff needing transcodes? 
If it does it'd prob work with a bit of tweaking 
Otherwise I'm not really willing to make it scrape a whole damn site 
I'm sure there is a user script for it 
If there is then it wouldn't be hard 
But there has to be something which does that 
take your pic 
Ok cool

That would help me out a lot ;~;

how do I set perms correctly 
so I don't fuck up the system 
shouldn't need to do much 
I'm pretty sure that symlinks maintain same permissions 
lrwxrwxrwx 1 wiz wiz 42 Sep 3 19:54 torrents -> /var/lib/transmission-daemon/info/torrents 
Ye 
That looks fine 
but 
I can't even cd into it 
Oh 
maybe restart the shell? 
Then chown it 
chown wiz ~/torrents 
? 
Ye 
Well sudo 
That's implied lol 
ye 
hmm still won't let me cd into it 
could it be because it's going to a root directory? 
I did ln -s /transmission/torrent/directory/ /home/wiz/torrents 
Wait 
Hmm 
The only thing that makes sense is you improperly symlinked 
o 
but most things are saying I did okay 
Odd 
So you symlinked it like 
yea 
If you did that command 
Then it should be fine >.> 
Hmm 
is that dir on another HDD 
Or another partition 
That might also do it 
I think it may be on another part 
let me take a look 
nope all on the same part 
Weird 
chowned ur mom lmao 
pls bo1g aka bug 
wtf 
ur buggin me lmao 
anyone want to fork me 
I'll fork your dongles m8 :^) 
(^: 
make a pull request bby ;;;))))))) 
ayy bb u wan sum fork :^) 
it's all open source if you know what I'm sayin 
What kinda license you got there ;) 
GNU General Public 
;) 
lewd 
Luminarys: so am I fucked or 
idk why it isn't allowing me 
Hmmm 
Try hardlinking? 
so ln blah blah 
no -s? 
Thoguh wait 
you can't hardlink a dir 
I'm dumb 
So you're sure that you aren't linking across partitions? 
Mmm 
Nice theme btw 
lol forgot the ip was there 
but it's a generic one from my phone company 
ty 
get haxd 
I wonder who gave it to me 
:^) 
or do you mean the zsh theme? 
zdh 
zsh* 
I assume it's OMZ 
uh 
darkblood I think 
OhMyZSH 
ye 
what else is there? 
I dunno 
YOu could always DIY 
that's decent.. 
pls 
me diy? 
I'm psure nuck did that :D 
:^) 
You can dew it 
Also gdit 
Fuckin utf8 
kek 
This is the last bug to iron out in the falc bot 
For some reason some non unicode char is flipping shit out 
And it's not even a kana/kanji 
It's like a | 
｜ 
yep 
rip serveer 
Does it show up weird? 
nope 
I see it fine 
| 
20:46:19<@Luminarys> ｜ 
lol 
It ends up somehow being the \\uff5c char in UTF 
Weird AF 
try petting it and saying that everything will be okay 
works for me 
Or just except it 
But fuck that 
I'm not going the lazy way 
I typically do try that a few times bo1g 
Sometimes it works 
I hate nondeterminstic shit >.> 
oh FFS 
I literally fixed the issue by doing str.decode('utf-8') 
This is silly 
lol wut 
how did you fix all this 
my music files are so wrongly encoded it hurts 
and I can't deal with it 
Luminarys: my friend is helping me with the whole symlink thing 
I'll tell you the fix if we figure it out 
21:17:37<&WizBright> did you change the perms? 
21:17:41<@Sunako> Maybe 
21:17:43<@Sunako> Does it work 
21:17:46<&WizBright> if so, what did you change it to? 
21:17:47<&WizBright> it does 
21:17:50<@Sunako> No idea

Gotta finish it 
I set out to watch it

literally a time waster

Are you a masochist or something Wizzie >.> 
I am 
Ok fair enough 
I have SAO II waiting for me as well

I remember that 
there was youtube videos 
with that scene + linkin park 
kek 
Must of been gr8 
nah the only great thing are the doujins 
( *≖‿≖*) 
well 
that's done 
gave it a 6 
wow sugoi senpai 
Wow 
It was just fine 
oooooooooooooooooooooooo 
Naice tsunderella 
lol 
hi 
op moi 
ty 
You and forevabronze lol 
I hope IRC actualyl becomes a more sane place 
Since it seems as if forevabronze at the least is willing to +k the complete dumbasses 
Well kick 
I think forevabronze did a +b on lib tho 
lol 
yeah 
me and fb talked about doing that before even getting promoted 
because damn, lib really sucks 
i think kiyiko got banned today though? 
Yeaaa 
didn't read it, was busy renovating 
No Chii unbanned 
ah 
Well I'm for a slightly more moderated IRC 
i like btn irc 
you get kicked instantly if you even insult someone/racist-stuff 
Oh naice 
and banned if you can't actually listen 
Mmm 
Do the other mods care if you crackdown on IRC? 
lol 
dunno, don't know if i will either 
Well at the very least it's good if you remove complete trolls like Lib/Kiyiko 
kiykio did the same shit on what.cd 
tried to bait people into insulting him 
then try to get them banned 
he got banned himself instead lol 
Jesus 
Like I actually took him seriosuly for the first few times 
Then I just /ignore and went on with my day 
lol 
but 
how will we get our source of entertainment 
scj :p 
Also lib really isn't entertaining 
He's just like "fk u gyz" 
"fking wmn" 
lmao 
That about sums him up 
also "thts gy" 
I actually dont think I've seen him 
yet 
just scj 
He's either spouting MRA stuff, cursing everyone out, or calling stuff gay 
I can send you my logs of everything he's said 
It's somehwat funny 
I just hope he's not serious 
he probably is 
Yea that's the sad part >.> 
[19:39:25] <Lib> rice with cum buggers 
starts well 
Oh god like one third of these are him saying stuff like "Is anyone there" "someone talk to me" 
I didn't realize how much of it there was >.> 
jesus fuck 
fuckin alcoholics 
Oh man E1999/ruri 
I don't think I have him on ignore because it's fun to sarcastically argue with him 
oh my god it keeps going 
or is this your entire log ever 
>*** Lib was kicked by blossom (blossom) 
heh 
ikr 
Finally today 
FINALLY 
As I said before 
Mods are Gods 
And ye, this is all the logs I have 
damn 
Probably not good for your health to read this for extended periods of time 
yeah I skimmed 
thats some spammy ass shit 
Ye 
It's just trash 
99% of it is of no value 
The only people who act that way are really Kiyiko/Lib and sometimes E1999/ruri 
I think that E1999/ruri is just mad about the touhou circlejerk in mainchan 
guess I'll bring a kancolle circlejerk into it to balance it out 
[23:02:25] <ruri> i love touhou 
[23:02:30] <ruri> only listen to touhou remixes 
[23:02:34] <ruri> wish my gf was into touhou 
kek 
lol 
Luminarys: we should make a bot 
that uses what lib says 
and has it only respond to him 
That's against the rules tho >.> 
create a bot with that neural stuff 
No bots in mainchan 
lame 
well.. 
make it in another chan he is in 
I tried training a neural network on lib's stuff 
But it's not enough samples 
damn 
Also I could just add in a module to my current bot framework 
That'd be easy 
I need to implement a piping module tbh 
Jesus the main chan is so bad >.> 
see thats no fun 
you have to make a bot that takes everything he's said 
and makes NEW SENTENCES 
then it'll be worthwhile 
Err yea 
That's what it was supposed to do 
Train a neural network on Lib's stuff 
Then try to make new sentences 
oh just read that 
:ppp 
Ah, np 
Anyways, it kinda sorta worked 
I want to do that with a telegram chat I have a bunch of friends in 
But again, not enough samples 
It's not hard 
Just have to have an nvidia GPU 
why dont you just plug in that log lol 
Sure, I have it all setup 
ah 
how does that work? is there a writeup somewhere? 
Ye 
I used that 
I had to fiddle around with the setup abit 
Torch isk inda weird 
well this is definitely more complicated than I thought 
You'll want to be on leenucks 
And again, need nvidia 
Or it's incredibly slow 
Like INCREDIBLY slow 
my linux box is on vultr and my home setup is W10 
Ok, then ur rekt 
I bet there's one of these for python 
yep 
pybrain 
It's probably slow AF is my guess, though I dunno 
Lua is generally regarded as the best lang for these things apparently 
which is weird to me 
I hate lua 
on the level of PHP and Ruby imo 
I've never learned it 
So no opinion 
We have ruby shills in here ya know 
PHP is complete crap though 
I learned ruby 
I don't need to learn another scripting lang tbh 
but when I started Rails I wanted to actually kill myself 
So not learning ruby 
Oh god 
What made it bad? 
I mostly hated it because it was so slow 
but when you start a project it made like ten folders 
and tutorials would be like put that here and this here and then run it 
ten minutes after running 
error 
I did that for a day then moved to python 
goddamn what a terrible experience 
Fucking gross 
I hate langs with shit tooling 
Go pushes it for me 
But it's still ok 
bloated is a good word 
I mean python is pretty bloated 
yeah thats why everytime I use Go I just go do the same thing in Py 
But I see that as a good thing 
It's meant to make shit easy AF 
meh it's not terribly bloated 
yea 
the thing I'd like to see and might exist is some sort of package manager like node has 
where it installs every dep you used if you install it elsewhere 
and you know, backwards compatibility sucks 
Oh yea 
Pythons 2/3 divide is so bad 
One of the worst things about it imo 
Just makes life a pain for both users and developers 
dafuq 
rsync --existing still tries to do stuff with irrelevant files 
maybe it doesnt like you 
Weird 
It was hung up on some dumb permissions errors 
works fine now 
is that commie ebooks twitter using some sort of neural network 
Link? 
I always figured it just had an algorithm for forming sentences from an IRC 
one sec 
I've never found any info about this bot 
Looks like it 
In general anything whcih can form sentences almost but not quite there is probably a bot 
well yeah I just dunno how 
It's not hard 
Twitter has a simple API 
like I said I figured it was an algorithm not a whole neural network 
Oh, it's likely a neural network 
I mean the way neural network basically work 
Is they save 'states' 
And let the person who ran it inspect statistics about each state 
And determine which state is the best 
THen you have the option to run the program against that state 
And it'll try to generate an output 
interesting 
States are pmuch a black box 
They're the result of training 
So I imagine they just run a program to generate an output from some state 
oh 
it's just 
And just send that to twitter 
a markov chain 
Oh 
lmao 
That's some easy shit 
How long is it? 
no idea I just googled and found that 
I guess he doesn't say 
time to learn markov chains 
Oh they're simple 
The neural network is like a more complex version 
Basically in this context it's a word weighter 
So let's say we want a chain of length N 
You'd make an array where you say 
Well where you keep track of N letters and check probabilities 
The first column of the array would be every single first word found 
Well the count 
interesting 
Then the second would be the count of the number of times another word follows antoher word 
Actually the array is goign to increase by N times for each word 
Well not N, but the number fo different combos 
So it can get really big 
But basically at the end you get a probability structure 
That says if we start with word X 
we have probabiltiy I of going to word Y, probability J of going to word Z, etc. 
And it has that for N times 
sorta like swiftkey predictions 
So then you just pick random numbers and follow the chain 
And whatever you get you get 
Not too sure what those are 
This is a dumb thing I did a while back with Markov chains 
Rock paper scissors bot 
Basically dic = {"rrr":1,"rpr":1,"rrp":1,"rps":1,"rsp":1,"rss":1,"rpp":1,"rsr":1,"rrs":1,"srr":1,"srp":1,"srs":1,"spr":1,"spp":1,"sps":1,"ssr":1,"ssp":1,"sss":1,"prr":1,"prp":1,"prs":1,"ppr":1,"ppp":1,"pps":1,"psr":1,"psp":1,"pss":1} 
oh wow 
Kept track of every single combo 
It's a 2nd order chain 
So tracks next two moves 
As you play it builds up the probabilities 
I actually wasn't able to beat it 
funny when I was learning how to use socketio I made a rock paper scissors game 
just a funny coincidence 
rock paper scissors is always a fun/simple way to do stuff 
I got the idea from the /g/ programming projects chart 
I was like why not learn markov chains and do a dumb rock paper scissors game at the same time 
thing with telegram api is it'll only fire things if the bot receives a message 
which is easy for learning I guess 
Sure 
I can just make it so there's a 5% chance of saying something on message interception 
Subtly troll the people 
right now I have it set up so there's a 1% chance of tweeting the last message intercepted 
which has been fun 
kek 
my favorites are when she tweets things like 'good job bot' 
really though I've wanted to make some sort of semi-intelligent secretary robot 
Wouldn't even be that hard, but lazy >.> 
it's just that I'm used to scripting 
once you go into AI you have to understand lots of things that seem a little overwhelming 
but yeah just have to sit down and do it 
and that twitter you just linked is pretty easy too 
Meh, kinda like that for everything 
probably hooks into something like weather channel api and then there's a folder full of anime qt pngs 
Ye ofc 
It's just cool 
And Akari <3 
dont remember what the module was but there is a photo manipulation one for python 
Oh jesus: https://github.com/shockone/black-screen 
Why would you do this >.> 
because rice 
doesnt look bad 
but 
that's it 
kinda neat tbh 
I wouldnt use it though 
It just seems bloated and unnecessary 
fun fact one of the main devs for electron helps develop a kancolle viewer written for electron 
And having lol 
I was trying to make one myself and I found out he's the main guy for both 
funny 
@_@ 
lmao 2/6 of top devs for electron have anime profile pics 
they're all chinese too iirc 
they seem nice though. main guy speaks some english 
Mmm 
Actually developing electron seems interesting 
Using it not so much for me >.> 
electron is nice it's just that writing desktop apps in JS is a little weird 
but not terrible 
I want JS to stay in the browser lol 
makes UI easy at least 
Electron? 
yeah it just processes HTML and stuff 
Oh that's neat 
nerds 
The thing is that XML really isn't sane for GUIs imo 
wow look at that nerd 
But that's the web :D 
hi 
hi nerd 
Did you see the fun going ons in main chan tsunderella? 
lol 
when? 
An hour or two ago 
Very fun 
rfahjsdkfhasd 
Yes, someone actually said this 
And from what it seems did it to 
Very delightful xDDDDD 
heh 
lumi 
? 
you were part of the logos thing 
I thought that died 
yep :^)))) 
I'm working on redoing riceDB in Go 
petition to rename to memeos 
nice logo tho 
Ye the logos are actually really decent 
I'm on my last can of soda 
panic 
OH NO!!!!!! 
did you break telegram bo1g...... 
you broke it didnt you...... 
yeah I saw that too 
it died 
that electron emulator looks pretty cool to be honest 
but would i want my terminal emulator to be mostly web-stuff? 
i doubt it 
yea 
looks nice 
tho 
oh yay this again 
oh yay.

how can a bug paste for you 
idk, there was a joke somewhere about calling you bug 
they cant click mouse buttons 
maybe if they jump hard enough 
they can try their hardest and maybe someday they will lissy

Is the job required for school/apartment? 
(I'm guessing since it is unpaid) 
yeah, because i'm unemployed

soonish 
How's things in here. And who are Wizzie and Mei-mei 
I know tsunderella is lissy 
Hi nuck 
Speaking of which when did you become mod 
hi nuck, this is wizbright 
nuck, around yesterday 
Well congrats then 
ty ty 
Wizzie: OH 
That makes more sense 
Did you make aldy's profile thingy Mei-mei ? 
it looks eerily similar to yours 
I've been gone too damn long 
also Boooo!! ε=(⊃≧□≦)⊃ 
No, he made it himself 
Booooo~ 
囧 
He borrow my psd though 
I knew he got something from you :3 
Where have you been nuck? 
Overworked 
:<

I'm doing PHP contracting 
Fuck PHP with a dragon dildo 
Preferably that one that's like 5 inches diameter 
And not even the soft version either, I mean the one that's super-hard 
So it hurts 
php sux 
Luckily now I'm doing Rails stuff for thr weekend 
And life is good 
Wizzie pats nuck on the head ( ´・ω・`)ﾉ（*￣‿￣*） 
oh and nice to meet you nuck 
Yes hello Mei-mei 
nuck is a dev for hummingbird Mei-mei 
among other talents and occupations 
taaaalents 
lol 
By talents and occupations you mean "miserable freelancer" 
But you gotta pay the bills somehow 
Because anime sure as hell doesn't 
You make it sound more depressing :< 
:D 
woah there's all sorts of fun people in here now 
Ahh that's so impressive 
I'm a grizzled old grumpy-ass coder 
I'm barely 21 and I'm already an old man, what is wrong with me 
I would be too if I did rails and php all the time 
Ey, Rails is nice 
It's like skiing 
You have no control over where you're goingf

There's one destination and that is gravity 
maybe thats why no one emails me 
But holy shit you're going so fucking fast towards gravity 
please 
the earth is flat 
Well of course 
gravity doesn't exist 
gravity is real, it's just what keeps the flat earth on a turtle's back 
duh 
we are falling through space at 6.98m/s^2 
Probably much more than that 
Also 6.98 m/s^2 seems wrong 
Are we really accelerating? 
Like the problem with all this is that it's all based on frames of refernce >.> 
we are accelerating through space at 6.98m/s^2 to create this so called "gravity" 
I hope you know I am bullshitting you all... It's a stupid theory 
Err 
Gravity is 9.8m/s^2 
I love the Flat Earthers 
I'll have you know :^) 
o 
It's been awhile 
NERD 
Get rekt 
please 
The fact that we've got photos from the space station, and you can actually just fly around the earth 
But they still think the earth is flat 
that's a hoax 
air travel is? 
The moon landing was fake :^) 
It's a gubment conspriacy :^) 
You're just flying across a flat surface nuck :4 
:3 
it's flat the image is proof 
think about it we dont have any 3d images of earth 
checkmate liberals 
brb sending a holographic camera into space 
lmao so I was bored and made yet another dotfile manager >.> 
I don't wanna manually copy a bunch of crap to some random dir and keep it maintained, so wrote some semi automator to do it for me :D 
lol 
yeah i did the same 
manager? 
I just store it in git and symlink it into place with a makefile 
riceDB does symlinks 
But they cause issues with some stuff 
Really? 
That's stupid 
vim in particular had some weirdness 
wat 
I use symlinks with vim 
And I have a pretty hardcore vim config 
I dunno, somehow a few of my plugins flipped out 
What are you using for plugin management in vim? 
I've had no trouble with anything installed by Vundle 
Pathogen 
Pathogen just blew up constantly for me 
i c 
I never had an issue with pathogen 
But perhaps one of these days I'll upgrade 
I liked the control but I've more recently accepted the fact that control = waste of my time 
Kind of like how Zuckerburg has a bunch of identical shirts to avoid having to think about what to wear 
I've been letting other people worry about things instead of me 
lol 
personal stylist that dresses you every day 
I have one of those 
it's me 
I do that. 
impressive 
yeah it's an american thing 
Lol what is this dotfile manager Luminarys ? 
I also need to make a backup of all of mine （ ´_ゝ`） 
o 
I see it 
looks neat 
Ye 
Clever naming :^)))) 
feels kinda like git to me 
Wizzie clones another Luminary repo （ ´_ゝ`） 
nuck waits 3 months for Luminarys to abandon it 
Meh, this is a one shot thing 
lol 
Also I'm still working on RiceDB 
It's almost completely ported to Go :D 
noice 
I'm trying to move from python to go tbh 
good \o/ 
tfw idk what to program in 
or what to properly learn

oppai 
lol 
just pick something 
Ruby :D 
nuck tells everybody to try Ruby 
No 
I'm looking at picking up Elixir soon 
Go 
Oh ye, learning Erlang atm 
Go is boring shit 
It just werks :^) 
Go is just Erlang with a shitty C syntax 
I'd rather have Erlang with a Ruby-esque syntax 
ie Elixir 
It's just non functional 
Erlang is pcool tho 
Hot code patches seem neat 
Have you watched the movie? 
? 
Erlang: The Movie 
Actual thing 
Erlang's tagline is amazingly still awesome and relevant: declarative realtime programming 
declarative programming is awesome 
Ye 
Is the audio supposed to be only in one ear? 
It's from the 80s 
This stuff makes my head hurt >.> 
What do you expect, stereo? 
lol 
I mean I know about erlang and it's uses/properties 
That's why I'm learning it >.> 
This video is just fun 
Seems more useful than Haskell at any rate 
Because it's the 80s 
Very very 80s 
Just look at their mustaches 
mmm 
Oh god this one smug guy 
which one 
At 2:20 or so 
Dat face 
hahaha that guy 
>emacs 
Also I love that their log outputs look exactly like mine 
lol 
A bunch of random symbols strewn at left 
god damn i have when there is only sound from one direction 
makes my brain hurt 
lol 
This video is all actual Erlang language developers too 
Like, these are the guys who invented it 
iktf tsunderella 
It actually gives me a headache 
that smug guy is Mike Williams 
The guy with the glasses is Joe Armstrong 
it's really hard to copy the left channel to the right 
ha ha it's not 
The guy at the computer is Robert Virding 
The three co-inventors of Erlang 
Erlang does have the philosophy of "let it crash" 
Yes it does 
It's a great approach 
Which actually makes alot of sense because it's always smaller processes 
I agree, it's very interesting 
And because it's declarative it's easy to build 
Dat hot patch 
Yep 
So how are you learning Erlang? 
lol 
learn you some erlang :D 
Isn't that by Zed Shaw 
Oh god it is 
Or no 
it isn't 
oh thank god 
Yea 
Fuck Zed Shaw 
I was panicking for a second 
What a douche 
^ 
How about you? 
Dunno yet 
I'm not learning 
Who's your favorite programming blogger/commentator/author/pundit? 
fuckin microsoft 
Hmm, I dunno 
google visual c++ 10 express 
My favorite is Steve Yegge 
top result for the download takes you to their site that says THERES A NEW ONE AVAILABLE with NO download links 
and the big download link does nothing 
fuckin GREAT 
Guy's brilliant 
And so incredibly hateful towards Java 
While admitting it's better than C++ 
I'm on the line as to whether or not C++ is worse/better than Java 
THey're both bad imo 
I actually know Java though, but not C++ 
At least Java's syntax is well-defined 
Ye, Java doesn't have a clusterfuck of stuff built in 
C++ has so many flaws in the syntax that it has a larger parser than Ruby 
And Ruby has an excuse: they valued the programmer over the compiler 
lol: FieldTiller till(), the ChamberPotEmptier empty(), or the RegistrationManager register() 
Too damn accurate 
I once looked through Spring's API 
I kinda died 
AbstractBeanCounterFactoryGenerator() type stuff >.> 
hmmmmm 
anyone know the limit of cat6 on top of their head 
com.sun.java.swing.plaf.nimbus.InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState 
org.springframework.aop.framework.AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean 
Both real classes 
I love the latter one 
Because of the docs 
Luminarys: there are no go books in the gentooman collections :< 
It literally jut says "Convenient proxy factory bean superclass for proxy factory beans that create only singletons" 
It's too new 
Wizzie, just go with python 
Go is not "too new" 
Well too new for gentoomen library 
It's just not interesting or useful for pretty much anything 
python basically has every fucking library ever 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Meh 
I may just learn C and call it a day. 
Learning C is good 
If you value programming time over runtime, use Ruby or Python or JavaScript 
But yea 
If you value runtime over programming time, use Erlang, Scala, etc. 
You have to deal with alot of stuff 
If you need it to run on lots of things, like a library 
Use C 
but I heard C is C 
If you value runtime and programming time use Go :^) 
No, Go is a waste of time too 
There's no "both" 
It's fast and fairly high elvel 
Yes except it is 
Node.js comes close 
And it's concurrent like Erlang 
Go is concurrent 
But it's not high level 
It's one of the few OO langs which has a non braindead concurrency system 
It's high elvel 
You can say it is but it's not 
Barely high level 
It's on par with Erlang or Java 
Ok sure 
In which case 
Use Erlang or Java 
And by Java I mean Scala 
Because don't use Java 
Yea but still stuck wiht JVM in Scala 
Which isn't terrible, but my understanding is taht it has some flaws 
The thing is, Erlang is functional, Go is OO 
I mean once I actually learn Erlang well I'll decide which is better 
Go is not really OO from waht I've seen 
It's OO 
pure composition 
No inheritance 
It's largely functional, it just promotes the fact that functional programming can also have objects 
Which is the right way to do OO imo 
Like, a lot of people forget that functional programming also has objects 
Ye 
But they're all immutable 
And functions do things 
Does Go use mutable things? 
Not objects 
Ye 
Heavily? 
It uses structs 
ah 
Yep 
Well 
My next language I'm gonna learn is actually Swift 
>.> 
I read about half the Swift book 
And holy shit this is amazing 
>.> 
wow.. 
apple fanboy huh.. 
I dunno anything about Swift except Apple 
And /g/ tells me it's a meme :^) 
lol 
swift is probably good for apple products 
Swift is actually a fascinating realistic language 
wouldn't surprise me 
How so? 
What're the good qualities 
but i kinda hate that apple rolls with Metal 
It's based on the traditional Smalltalk OOP which is shared with ObjC and Ruby 
Of message-sending instead of method-calling 
It's got a simple concept of "constants" which are used throughout the language 
Which allow making immutable variables easily 
If you use `let` to define a string, it becomes an immutable string 
If you use `var` it's a variable 
Allowing optimization 
The syntax is pretty solid, being somewhere between ObjC and ES6 
With a sprinkling of C# 
gdi my scrot script stopeed working on me 
stopped* 
It's not like... an interesting language 
So of course /g/ is not all up on it 
They're autistic, they want the new shiny 
Nah 
/g/ hates new things 
They hate Go and Rust for the most part 
But I'd say Swift is a really well thought out language 
You kidding? /g/ loves new things, they're just hipsters 
^ 
They like it until it goes mainstream 
At which point they complain that it's "not as good anymore" 
its just typical 4chan mentality that you need to shit on everything though 
Ye 
And talk about old languages which were "so much better" 
Like C 
4chan is never going to agree on anything 
i think i might be addicted to the hipster way though 
trying new stuff is fun 
BASIC 4 lyfe 
I love new stuff, and I know I'm a hipster 
but I just embrace it 
I like good stuff 
Don't care about the age >.> 
Swift is thoughtful and deliberate 
It's not experimental 
I'd say it's Apple's response to C# 
It's not an amazing magic new concept of a language. It's just a really pleasant language to work with 
That's how i feel about Go tbh 
I've never been able to get into Go more than a day 
I'll spend a day learning Go, and then get bored because it's just so damn bland 
It doesn't solve any problems I've seen 
in my eyes 
And it's not enjoyable like Ruby was 
Go is just what I wanted in Python 
Concurrency? 
Good concurrency and networking 
Not slow as shit 
that and compiled 
Decent OO 
i prefer compiled a lot 
^ 
And it's all very simple 
I'm a big fan of Smalltalk OOP 
Luminarys: pls help my script borked ;~; 
C++ and Java and that family completely fucked up on OOP 
^

03717.png: No such file or directory 
Hmm 
Paste it? 
you guys are a bunch of dorks! 
Youmu is a dork 
wat 
tbh I would love Obj C if it weren't for that fucking method call syntax 
you mean the two who 
fuckin weeb 
:D 
You guys ever play with Vala? 
highly recommend it 
I don't want to do anything with GUIs 
It's like C#, but it compiles straight to C and builds on the GObject runtime 
or GNOME/GNU 
haha 
You can use it without GUIs 
That's just me though 
It's basically just C# 
With some added niceties 
I might learn C# one of these days 
Hmm 
This seems odd Wizzie 
I know 
maybe the naming scheme is killing it somehow 
Do you have the file being made? 
it is made yes 
And is the name 03717.png? 
150906 04643.png 
ahh 
it is adding a space 
somehow 
Dafuq 
Ah, here's one of the cool things from Swift 
I don't even know 
> theWidth = windows("Main")?.views(5)?.size.width; 
Called "optional chaining" 
Also known as "null propogation" in C# 
Try just doing: scrot '%y%m%d%k%M%S.png' 
(which is getting it in the next vesion) 
But basically, it means that, if any function returns null just keep chugging 
150906 04807.png 
Ok, so scrot is making the files incorrectly for some reason 
try scrot '%Y-%m-%d_$wx$h.png' 
I think your capitalization might be the issue if that works 
2015-09-06_1366x768.png 
ahh it's the %k 
Ye ok 
You should try ut Swift later this year when it comes to Linux 
it's doing a plan 0 
:D 
instead of 00 
which book? 
;~; 
KnR 
K&R is boring but amazing 
^ 
eip me? 
rip* 
lol 
Not really 
It isn't terribly boring 
Just very straight and to the point 
I got about halfway through K&R before I said fuck it 
And got to the real point 
By which I mean I just started writing code 
C is like 90% the OS API 
Once you learn the basics then you just have to use manpages 
Once you cover pointers 
You're pretty much done 
pointers and structs 
Structs are just fancy pointers 
kk 
So up to chapter 6 
5* 
Do they have frills 
are they frilly 
Yes 
good 
lol 
I've had some fun with structs before 
Gotta use the frills 
I'm surprised you didn't comment about the page Luminarys 
Like I wanted a type in RAM which was basically packed as [uint32, char...] 
Wizzie, why dont you have any index pages 
on your site 
lame. 
because 
I don't want you snooping :^) 
wow telegram is fucking dead 
not anymore 4 me 
For taht type in RAM I actually created a struct of `uint32 name; char thing;` iirc 
is #mango the new #linux 
And then over-allocated and intentionally read the buffer manually 
my bot's hitting timeouts 
:D 
Wizzie, "snooping" 
just put something 
Yea, C is super hacky 
yeah dont be lazy wizzie 
Which also causes many of its problems 
It's a thin wrapper around the von neumann architecture 
Mhm 
You're interfacing directly with RAM 
Which is a lot of power 
C is incredibly powerful 
Ye 
But also dangerous in that way 
But it also means you run into buffer overflows, etc. 
Which is part of why I built that type 
I was writing crypto code 
So I wanted length-delimited strings 
For *everything* 
Ye 
Much harder to overflow if you don't use null-delimited strings 
null delimited was a mistake >.> 
Plus I was dealing with bytestrings because crypto 
So I couldn't do null-delimited 
There might be nulls in the encrypted data 
Related: fuck OpenSSL 
Use Libre :D 
I was working with OpenSSL, and hte first thing I did was write an MD5 function which I could use for the stuff I was writing 
But the OpenSSL API for this would segfault randomly 
If you tried to feed it a string 
You had to feed it in raw-memory mode 
It was bizarre and horribly broken 
It took me months to figure that out 
lol 
I still want to finish writing that someday. It was a C library for 1Password Keychains 
I was gonna build it as a lib then build a GTK GUI on top 
>1password 
Le meme password manager 
Well still an interesting project 
lolwat 
You just got meme'd 
1password is a bad thing 
well meme'd 
They've been breached multiple times 
... breached? 
m'eme 
wtf are you talking about 
i.e. 
My shit isn't stored on their servers, and I know exactly how my shit is encrypted 
Alot of user info got stolen 
Nicely meme'd 
uh 
what? 
are you sure you aren't thinking of lastpass Luminarys 
Are you sure you didn't mix them up with LastPass 
lol 
Which has gotten breached like 4 times 
Oh 
lastpass 
fuck me 
I'm dumb 
lol 
MEME'D THE FUCK DOWN 
LastPass is genuinely bad. You don't know how your crap is stored there 
1password I can't comment on 
Probably fine 
Once again 
1password is closed-source, but very upfront about how they encrypt 
>reading comprehension 
I suck >.> 
Whatever 
When I asked for help with building libopkeychain, they handed me some stuff to test against and wished me luck 
And showed me the documentation of their format 
I just like my keepass >.> 
Oh cool 
I mostly love hte convenience of 1password 
Cmd+\ 
Boom, logged in 
i just use pass 
manually copy my passwords 
And it syncs to my phone over dropbox 
That seems insecure if you can unlock with a keybind >.> 
Not unlock 
It stays unlocked and resident 
Ah 
But locks when your computer sleeps or after a period of time 
Similar thing for KeePass 
And it has nice browser integration 
As well as apps 
Yeah KeePass and 1password are both great options 
1password is just prettier :D 
(and way more expensive) 
lol 
1password meets my needs perfectly, but I want to have a Linux desktop eventually 
And when that happens, I want to use that instead of the browser crypto shit they offer 
Hence libopkeychain 
i want a yubikey 
Problem with a yubikey is that you can't do two-factor cryptography 
All you can do is validate 
No real protection 
It's like using a spoon to scoop the cum out after sex so you don't get pregnant 
It's not gonna do anything 
Just make you look like an idiot 
wtf 
Hey, it's accurate 
Umm 
interesting analogy 
I'm the king of interesting analogies 
I use anal fisting analogies when I'm describing programming often 
The best kind of analogy 
i prefer car analogies 
I guess you could say I put the anal in analogy 
Naice naice 
I say things like "I'm gonna have to shove my hand up the codebase's ass and shuffle things around a bit for this" 
interesting 
"I'mma have to rush A and hope to take them from behind while they attempt to go to B." Analogy for Lissy 
shush 
:^) 
Wizzie • [HorribleSubs] Shimoneta - 10 [720p].mkv • 12:16/23:46 • 455MB • Paused 
why am I watching this 
wizzie 
we've had this talk 
if you have to ask that 
its very good okay 
FUCKING DROP IT 
no 
there are far worse shows this season wtf 
u 
Lissy is secretly like Anna or Kajo? 
so the answer to that is to watch the least worse? 
Wizzie, no. 
:3 
:T 
i have dropped 3 shows from this season 
probably will drop some more 
Luminarys do you have that log handy still I want to try this markov thing and I want some raw data 
which have you dropped? 
Sure 
I dropped bikini warriors even though it's a short 
Which one? 
the really long one you had of that one guy will work 
forgot his name already lol 
I've dropped everything but GATE and Shirayuki 
Oh Lib 
I'm watching none of those 
sure 
yeaa 
how is Shirayuki? 
only watched 3 eps 
its okay though 
i'm behind in a looooot of shows because i've been busy 
haven't watched anynthing in a week either 
It's quite nice 
AOTS for me 
think i'll have to pack down my computer today 
Just a sec bo1g 
Heroine subs might be the one I get for the show 
ty ty 
poor lissy 
lol 
gonna have to buy 2 10 meter ethernet cables too 
poor thing 
Wizzie, pls no mocking 
you said you were going to stain your desk again too? 
thanks. I'll let you know how it goes 
lol "again" 
k 
I'm curious as to how your results will compare to mine 
bought wood for $177 
so i need to oil it 
o 
make sure to prep it right 
made the desk myself 
yeah 
feels pointless to buy an ikea desk for $150 in worse quality 
are you going to put a coat of poly on it too? 
er 
3-4 coats of poly* 
nah, not going to coat it, the oil will be good enough 
dunno the name of the oil though 
its not a heavy one anyway 
eh 
for wood 
trust me omgggggg 
A coat of Polyurethane wouldn't be too bad. 
helps protect the surface 
and makes it smooth 
pls lissy 
I sell paint and stain all day 
pls.. 
i just don't know the english terms 
its probably a coat 
if you don't care about the look of wood, doing an enamel would make the surface even better 
looks more like it was painted 
i can snap you the stuff later 
polyuretan 
lol 
that's apparently the swedish word 
for polyurethane 
It's just a clear coat for protection 
pretty sure most of those are glossy though 
it's a glossy coat I suppose 
yeah not gonna have glossy 
hmm 
kinda weird though 
yeah but bare stained wood doesn't seem like a good thing. 
didn't know that kind of stuff was called stain in english 
just makes me think of coffee stains 
it soaks into the wood and colors it right? 
the stuff that we're going to use doesn't really colour it 
you can either brush it on or wipe it on lol 
so is it clear? 
or 
supposed to be clear and matt 
neat 
Luminarys is watching [Zurako] Usagi Drop 01v2 (BD 1080p FLAC) [7E076DBD].mkv 00:09:56/00:22:52 [>>>>>>---------] (43%) 
:D 
that's not as pretty as mine 
Wizzie • [HorribleSubs] Shimoneta - 10 [720p].mkv • 14:17/23:46 • 455MB • Paused 
I agree 
No colors 
also so much text 
I'll modfiy the script so it actually looks decent 
mine is clear and concise :^) 
someone should make something like last.fm but for anime 
add realtime scrobbling to MAL 
hue 
very important 
We're actually trying to do that with Hummingbird 
then i could make .np 
but .nw instead 
Indeed 
now watching huehue 
We've got partnerships lined up with two major illegal anime streaming sites, where they could do scrobbling 
From there we can venture into realtime 
"major illegal" 
Haha 
lame.... 
Ey, it's a start 
And it's a public API 
i hate streaming sites with a passion :( 
earning money from piracy 
^ 
You can build a desktop scrobbler 
lol 
twist.moe 
No money made there 
No ads 
that's good at least 
i'm talking about shit like kissanime 
and their other 50000 sister sites 
Fuck KissAnime 
^ 
That said, I know their pain 
One ad per page doesnt't even remotely pay the bills in the anime market 
Too many users have adblock 
So they got increasingly more intrusive 
oh its down 
haha 
Ads on Hummingbird don't even pay 20% of server costs 
kissmanga is up still I'm sure 
how does HB get revenue then? 
its insaaaaaane how many streaming anime sites there are 
i don't get it 
crunchyroll is basically free for streaming anyway 
B-but muh placebo online quality :^) 
Wizzie: "Pro" accounts which basically just get you a badge, access to gated features early, and discounts at random sites 
But even that barely covers anything 
how is no one abusing "twist.moe" 
damn 
actually nvm, 50 bucks there are shitloads of android apps with 500 ads 
just loading videos from it 
but lissy I want my 1080p upscales 
I use Twist for when I'm on mobile 
Maybe I'll watch some anime tonight 
I haven't watched anime in weeks 
whole week here 
Last thing I watched was an episode of Digimon Adventure 
I'm rewatching that in dub because muhchildhood 
I had the time tonight 
so I am catching up on airing stuff 
And that was... a month ago 
And that was after a month and a half of no anime 
Last real anime I watched was Mikagura Ep 11 
hmm 
I may watch a movie next 
maybe Citizen Kane or Metropolis 
lol 
Maybe I'll finish out Mikagura tonight and start whittling down the blandness of Hyouka 
Wizzie • Citizen.Kane.1941.720p.BluRay.X264-AMIABLE.mkv • 0:00:12/1:59:23 • 4693MB • Playing 
Can I jus say: fuck the guys who told me to watch Hyouka over all the other cute KyoAnis I had in that strawpoll 
"Watch Hyouka" they said 
"It's amazing" they said 
fucking gits 
It's traaaaaaaaash 
The only redeeming parts are (1) good animation (2) cute characters 
And on (2) it's really just Satoshi and Mayaka 
hyouka is my favorite kyoani show 
fight me 
How do you survive the blandness 
Like 
This is so slow paced 
And not even cutesy sol stuff 
Clannad AS is good 
i'm not in a rush m8 
So is K-On 
I don't like much else Kyoani has done 
I love modern KyoAni 
I'm a KyoAni fanboi 
Hibike was decent 
why 
chuu2 was garbage 
Not great or anything 
Exactly 
chuu2 and knk was shit 
Free!, Chuu2, etc. 
soz. 
chuu2 was terribad, so was knk 
Chuu2 was cute 
chuu2 was pOOP 
Well 
i liked free though 
first season was better 
Free! was decent 
I only watched S1 
What was wrong with Chuu2 
boring? 
How is it boring 
It's literal chuuni shit 
chuu2 s2 felt pointless 
It's all about a chuuni girl 
literally no advancing, literally nothing happening 
I hate chuuni crap in the first place 
As somebody has been chuuni 
yeah and she's a boring character 
So ther's no way I'd like the show 
No advancing? 
You kidding? It was constant internal advancement 
handholding isn't advancing 
It was realistic 
It didn't go super love-story bullshit 
>realistic 
Which I appreciated it 
real life = first date = anal sex 
anime = first date = handholding 
Yes 
If you're a slut 
Wut 
:^) 
lol wut tsunderella 
that's intense 
(which I am) 
tfw single （ ´_ゝ`） 
tfw single ;D 
I'm a huge slut. I'd let a boy do me in hte bum on the first date 
lol 
I'd let him do me in the bum *before* the first date 
I bet you'd blow him after too nuck 
i just didn't like chuu2, that's about it 
You aren't apprciating it properly Wizzie 
:^) 
Wizzie: ew no 
that's nasty yo 
pls 
the main character was hella lame too 
you're the slut here 
Chuunibyou was like "I can commiserate" 
As in 
You wore an eye patch in school 
how am I not appreciating it properly Luminarys ? 
lol 
And did the stupidest shit properly 
possible* 
Damn close, Luminarys 
Fuck me 
not really 
I was incredibly chuuni in 6th grade 
And 8th grade 
Jesus christ dude 
Well, in whichc ase I can't comment 
In 6th grade it was obsession with harry potter 
With this girl 
inb4 nuck was a dragon 
rofl no 
We pretended we were wizards like some dumb fucks 
nuck did you poke her with your wand 
Oh my god Wizzie 
Dude she was like 7' 
Terrifying honestly 
I think she might've been geuinely part giant 
she was hagrids mom? 
But then in 8th grade 
kek 
(or however you spell it) 
I hung out with a bunch of emo naruto fangirls 
Oh god 
I did the naruto run 
Oh god 
I regret it everyt ime I think about it 
rip nuck 
And better yet 
I had obsession 
which headband did you have :^) 
With linux 
And also FMA 
:DDDD 
So my yearbook from that year 
Is covered in penguins and transmutation circles 
Oh my god 
YEP 
7th grade, strangely I was better 
no naruto headbands? 
I am hurt 
I didn't act like as huge of a faggot 
llol 
Wizzie: Nah I was too broke 
When did you discover your love of cock nuck 
weebs 
(just being blunt..) 
when did you discover yours Wizzie 
Probably once he started watching anime 
Haven't discovered it yet 
Took me until I was 19 to realize I was submissive as fuck and that there were only two girls I'd ever met who were dominant enough for me 
So about 3 years now? 
2-3 
damn 
Lissy is a sadist 
In my junior year of high school, when I was 15-16 I started getting into business stuff. My school had a virtual enterprise competition thing, and I just completely obliterated the competition 
Wizzie, lies 
nice :o 
Please tsunderella 
we never had fun stuff in school 
My team won so hard the teacher had to change the rules to give other people *something* 
don't deny the truth 
What did you guys do that knocked out everyone? 
blackmail 
hiring a hitman 
Our team created a (fake) smoothie company. So when it came time for the "exhibition" day, where the entire school got to vote on the companies they liked 
We had a booth with smoothies 
Actual 5 different varieties of smoothies 
Right the fuck there, we were blending them loudly 
going to quote myself, 
08:57:03 @tsunderella │ we never had fun stuff in school 
the fuck 
that sounds fun :( 
We took the shit booth 
We took the booth which didn't have a wall behind it 
Every other team was like "we want a wall!" 
And we just laughed at them and said "a wall doesn't win any customers" 
So we took the booth which was front and center upon entering the exhibition floor 
Improvised a pony wall behind our booth, wired it up for 5 blenders and started making asses of ourselves 
lol 
Best memory from high school 
dunno if i'd accept a smoothie from young high school guys :| 
Well, you could see us not pouring pills into the blender 
And everybody in school knew who we were 
what kidn of smoothies was it 
I don't even remember the varieties we did 
We just went to a discount grocery store and bought a bunch of bags of frozen fruits and berries 
Came up with some vague recipes 
That whole class was a hell of a fun time 
That was the second half, the first half we had to set up a whole 30-person company using the entire class 
We competed with other schools 
oh 
fancy 
But we were the strange school all the suit-wearing other schools were confused by 
We rolled up into the trade fair lot blasting rap music 
They stared at us like we were crazy 
It was fun. We lost, but damn if we didn't have fun yelling at people to grab a goddamn cupcake 
I was lucky to go to a strange high school. But I hear even normal high schools can be fun 
With their blowjob bathrooms 
Ours had a glory hole 
Well 
Actually it was just a hole punched in the wall by some angry pooping guy 
Fuck Google Maps 
This is bullshit 
kek 
All I want to do is have a pretty embed-API style map 
But with custom data 
I give it lat/longitude, address, name, and marker 
And it displays it in a pretty map 
But nooooooooo 
You wanna do that, you get dropped down into a shitty version of the map 
night night 
Night wiz

heh, did it myself Wizzie 
Actually I should include seconds in the time 
not bad 
kek 
Seems about right 
hahaah 
it honestly doesn't even seem computer generated if you think it is said by Lib 
Exactly 
He's incoherent half the time anyways 
show me your code bo1g 
It's not his code I wouldn't think 
got a little lazy towards the end 
Oh 
the class part isnt 
not really 
just some tutorial 
You made Markov fun 
Naice naice 
the name/main part processes a file and averages how many words per sentence 
lol 
one thing 
and adds up to three at random 
oh nvm 
you delete the name there 
do you even have to do that though 
every line starts with <Lib> nearly 
so it should have a very high chance to happen anyway right? 
Ok so it's a 2nd degree markov chain? 
yeah probably 
yeah it goes 1 2 / 3 
chains 3 with 1 
etc 
mhm 
had some unicode errors too so I had to add that try/except pass there 
but it only happened I think 9 times out of the whole file 
Oh yea, that stuff is annoying 
but I can just log my group chat with just words 
then process this every now and then 
telegram bot api still down it looks like 
:T :T :T 
:TTTTT 
lol 
I ran it again 
that first one 
what a magical thing 
Ah the classic fked 
too bad I couldnt get pybrain to work 
probably something to do later on 
<Lib> u got trolled xD every single when 
lol 
I wonder if I still have that long file of random shit you've said in telegram 
throw that into the script 
pls 
no. 
probably on my laptop 
i'll fuck u up 
YEP 
incoming liseda ebooks

its-happening.gif 
Could someone confirm somethign quickly? 
depends on what 
Also does my nick show up for that 
w a t 
Ah shit 
That's the issue 
I'm dumb 
I was writing text to the buffer, but not saying it in the buffer >.> 
>it here WOOF WOOF work

?does this work now? 
As spoiler text 
>the golan(g) just call in brogramming 
Luminarys, probaly not

its literally just 
09:47:29 @Luminarys │ ?does this work now? 
Gdit 
Hmmmm 
gentoo distro let kongou in... 
lmao 
>the mc is fucking you 
bo1g, are you using just the snippet you pasted

Luminarys, no just a ? still 
Gdit 
Hmmm 
bo1g, list index out of range 
Wait in that case 
oh wait 
Did my mpv script show colors or the ? 
nope

>girl is qt tho god damn ty 
Does this work? 
lol 
no. 
:DDDDD 
hi lumi! 
gidt 
I hate this stuff 
This? 
red! 
Oh shit 
Why the fuck do you do this to me weechat 
yeah i see red now 
How does this shit even work 
witchcraft 
So does this work as spoiler text? 
nothing! 
can see if I select it tho 
so yea 
Luminarys, yes 
I can do this fine within weechat, but not from my script >.> 
;-; 
lol 
I can't 
lol 
expensive ants!!!!!!! 
bot api still down 
guess I'll tanks some 
no. 
caught up on MANIME 
even watched an episode of something from two seasons ago wow 
I deserve a good tanking 
what show 
denki gai no honya san 
oh 
i wanted to watch that 
anime is weaker than the manga 
well honestly it might just be the OP 
I dont like the OP 
I hate it 
the show is pretty true to the manga mostly 
thats me being picky though 
Jesus how do I write control characters 
I have to write ^C to do colors 
But i have no idea how to actually get that character in >.> 
try adding -please to the end 
lmao 
does this work? 
If that worked this is really dumb 
I literally ssh'd into my server 
Uploaded text logs 
yeah i can see it 
its spoilered 
Downloaded them, and copied the ^C character 
Because I have no idea how to actually type it 
>dank memes 
i have no idea how to do it either 
neither in subl3 
time to start spamming this shit in main chan :^) 
so i just used my terminal emulator to insert shit with that mode and then copy pasted it 
I feel like I knew how to do it at some point 
lumi ebooks when 
I don't ever log anything because I'm a shitter 
Are you not gonna make the ebooks? 
no. 
i wont allow him 
lol 
I'll do it 
animebytes ebooks 
just of logs from the main chat 
though this one would be more entertaining imo 
mango 
just do what this other bot does in another channel i'm in 
it logs everything that is said in CAPS ONLY 
then it repeats a random CAPSED line each tome someone says something in CAPS 
lol 
its pretty funny 
but you need to build up a huge log kinda 
Ye 
yeah you could just have the script wait to fire until it reaches so many entries 
true 
well does anyone already have a log of the main chat 
I could just pre-populate it 
I hate that twitter requires you to give a phone number to use their API 
I'm already using the two I have handy 
i do 
can't grab it now though 
Alright 
Enough weechat script fun for tonight 
I'm off to bed 
bo1g, can't you get another pre-paid simcard 
cya folks 
i got one for my telegram bot 
Luminarys, bai bai 
nite lumi 
one is my main number and the other is my gvoice number 
I dont get that policy tbh 
sure it's good for maybe spam protection but a huge pain in the ass for devs 
lol 
sure sure 
but even devs makes spam bots after all 
should be able to create specific sub-accounts and only use them with the API or something 
sure but it would be nice to just have all my twitter apps in once place and have them interface with different accounts 
see that would be nice too 
lol 
I bet I can revoke the number after creating the app 
lets see 
yep lol 
nice twitter 
does weechat log by default or do I have to set that up 
yes it is nice 
oh maybe not 
wrong folder, it's all here 
hehe. 
nerd 
this has been logging since june 10th 
nice 
nice sample file 
okay 
so processing that log 
into this script 
returned http://pastie.org/private/hqkruxste0qckfzzommsuq 
it was still processing some satsuki commands which I've cleaned up http://pastie.org/private/vkd4axrngtmikrzptd92bw

Once I learn erlang good I'm gonna remake the bot 
Include module hotpatches 
And make it so that I can load modules by linking code in IRC 
That'll be fun 
gou-chan did nothing wrong 
.say uguu

Link Title: AnimeBytes eBooks sur Twitter : "anyone has posted nsfw loli No one's been posting nsfw loli here nope, whole" 
bo1g: I should really port it over to use for HS 
what, importing their IRC or Twitter? 
irc 
I have a nick for it 
I just needed a good script 
@horriblesubstxt 
Is there anything extra I need for it? 
to setup weechat and what not 
I'm just importing logs that weechat is using you'll need to adjust it based on your settings 
bo1g: I'm just importing logs that weechat is using you'll need to adjust it based on your settings 
Link Title: animebytes-ebooks/main.py at master · rekyuu/animebytes-ebooks · GitHub 
thanks gou 
see how on line 9 I have a list of ignorables 
so it scrapes out left/joined messages 
IGNORE is a list of commands that users post and it removes those too 
so after you have a cleaned up output file, markov reads that and sends an output 
so 
it's just really reading logs? 
yep 
I have this one set up to update every 24 hours 
I also set it up to average the amount of words a user posts + random number up to 9 for the output sentence 
do I run it as a stand alone app 
or do I need to have it running via weechat? 
it's just a python script 
it runs on it's own 
kk 
you'll need to define the logs location is all 
mkay 
mine runs in ~/dev/appname so I had to 
'../../.weechat/logs/etc' 
you also need an auth.py with a Twitter class for authing your app 
I'll give you a blank one one sec 
Link Title: Private Paste - Pastie 
I really need to figure out why it does that repetition thing 
...also, pip install twitter if you havent already 
kk 
Hmm bo1g any idea about how to create oauth stuff? 
do you already have the app set up on http://apps.twitter.com? 
Link Title: Twitter Application Management 
I do 
and so I just make an auth.py with that same structure as you pasted 
and mess with the log file location then bam? 
yeah, on your app page the keys you need are in keys and access tokens 
and yep 
should work 
just make sure it's cleaning the file properly 
weechat logs based on your weechat settings 
which is why I had to add '<<' and '<--' because I changed that later on 
so if you have something weird you'll need to add that 
was it written for python2? 
Luminarys nw [Zurako] Usagi Drop 04v2 (BD 1080p FLAC) [450C7C02].mkv 00:04:19/00:22:52 
I wrote the script myself Wizzie >.> 
python 3.4 wizzie 
lumi this is for the markov script lol 
I should watch usagi drop 
ik 
have had it for awhile 
It's just he was complaining the other day about it 
ohh 
It's quite nice 
looks pretty Luminarys ~ 
Thanks :D 
I also wrote some fun meme scripts while I was at it, but that's for another time 
I should think of more fun things to do with weechat 
weird 
pip only seems to be working with 2.7 
why do you even have that installed lol 
pip3 
or pip2 
Whenver you don't know for python attach a 2/3 respectively to the end of the program 
Also yea make sure pip3 is install 
It's weird though, because if you're using Arch linux 3 is the default 
I dunno how Antergos does it though to be fair 
no 
I am installing this 
on a server 
Ahh 
Then ye 
make sure python3 is installed 
as well as pip3 
And add that suffix 
If it's a deb server, it's probably 2 default 
figured it out 
it was python3-pip 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Ye 
lel 
> $ python3.2 main.py [±master ●] 
[1] 9019 killed python3.2 main.py 
lol wut 
3.2 wut 
jesus wizzie what are you doing 
that's what debian has （ ´_ゝ`） 
uninstall 
all pythons 
and only install 
3 
then py main.py 
THere's deps for python2 
I think 
oh really? 
yuck 
change os wizzie 
I think debian is stuck on 3.2 
Use Arch on your servers 
It's a server lol 
It's dabest :D 
yeah I'm using arch 
good stuff 
I use arch everywhere 
this is on my DO node 
Then do arch-chroot 
Or something 
There's def. script for it out there 
so 
Like if I wanted good hardening/security i'd prob use debian 
is the program killing itself or? 
But I get so much convenience out of Arch that it's def. worth it 
try just python3 instead of python3.2? 
I think that's a thing 
still kills itself 
sometimes python / py will differentiate 
I know on my arch machine I have to write python instead of py for whatever reason 
lol rip me 
and this neat bot 
install arch loser 
^ 
Join the meme team 
I remember using debian forever ago 
it's a good change wizzie 
yeah but 
it's my DO server 
no buts 
and 
Trust me, someone has amdea script to do it Wizzie 
I have all my other shit setup on there already （ ´_ゝ`） 
Link Title: gh2o/digitalocean-debian-to-arch · GitHub 
alternatively: move to vultr 
cheaper there too 
I imagine he gets DO for free 
DO is bad though 
They're abusive 
could be worse 
wouldnt say vultr is any better 
>.> 
when I started with them I had a lot of resets 
Just use LeaseWeb then 
they've been fine lately 
They have a good deal for their VPSs and aren't abusive 
I already pay $30 a month for 1.05TB 
er 
wat 
1TB and 50GB 
oh 
1TB badnwtih 
two servers 
50GB space 
no 
they're also expensive lumi 
unlimited bandwidth 
1TB VPS? 
1TB of space 
Through DO? 
ye 
no 
Wut 
friend 
wut 
Oh 
ye ok 
But DO 
4GB of ram 
how much do you pay for 50 GB 
4 cores 
I don't do that 
I am on the cheapest 
$5 a month 
Link Title: Virtual Servers | LeaseWeb 
There's a 40% discount code you can apply to these too 
$16/mo 
can use whatever os I want 
10 euros a month on LW 
you get 2 cores, 2 GBs, 60 GBs storage, 6 TBs badnwtih 
Seems like a better deal to me 
wtf where is that one 
probably 
but 
that github bundle thingy 
that free creditttt 
oh you posted it 
Link Title: Virtual Servers | LeaseWeb 
derp 
See M 
Yea 
where are the servers located though 
ForDo you not see S/M/L/XL? 
These are all VPSs 
oh good they have US ones 
Ye 
do they not have an option for custom os? 
Don't think so 
then rip 
But it's not hard to put your own on it I think' 
lol 
but back to this 
it hates me 
after you get the server, do you have an option in your settings? 
at least it doesnt give me the option on sign up 
Don't think so 
also if I used that script, wouldn't it rekt my files? 
YOu'd have to manually do it 
Woudln't it just scan your files Wizzie? 
idk? 
I'm scared ;~; 
Pshh, that's ignorance talking :^) 
the one I posted yeah 
just make a snapshot 
and back them up locally so you can reupload them 
run the script, get arch 
then bamarino 
mhm 
I cant find anything about custom os for leaseweb 
they seem nice though 
they had something about custom os partitioning was all I could find lol 
They're prob one of the best choices for serious hosting 
But they're not cheap for their dedis 
yeah noticed that 
Since I'm cheap I just use OVH >.> 
Can't beat that 15$ a month 
lol 
I may just run the bot on my own comp 
and pass it hexchat logs 
and see what happens 
you'll have to adjust the cleaning function probably 
Yea paying 15 euros I get a dedi with good CPU, 16 GBs RAM, 100 MBP/s unlimited conn, and 2 TBs of storage 
just make sure it's opening a file of JUST words 
The problem is they have a terrible(nonexistnat) support desk 
yuck 
? 
yuck no support 
Ye 
Terribad support 
I've never needed support thankfully 
Yea never had any problems with it 
I just cna't pass up such a good deal tbh 
It's the Jewish part of me >.> 
it is good but not if I cant have arch on it 
You can 
dont want to lock that in and be disappointed 
Unless you mean LW 
lw yea 
In whcih case I dunno 
I think you could 
At the very least you could chroot it and direct everything to that 
But that's an ugly solution 
maybe later down the road, vultr has been good to me so far 
mhm 
besides those hiccups at the start 
so I'm going to take my telegram bot and have it interface with a web ui to reset it and configure it 
which will be fun 
Naice 
I'm gonna go back to learning Erlang 
Wanna get the bot going soonish 
what bot is this one for? 
New IRC bot 
or what is this bot for 
sentences are hard 
Which actually werks 
whats wrong with go 
Nothing 
But erlang has many shiny features which I see as useful in the bot 
So I wanna make it more sanely in Erlang 
I've heard about it but not much else 
Erlang is cool 
Like Functional Go 
Though Erlang predates Go greatly 
well 
bo1g: it hates emotes 
No kaomojis allowed? 
oh you know python and unicode 
Python + Unicode = no fun 
just add a try/except:pass to have it skip that line 
well hold on 
Link Title: cxg.de - Code Exchange 
I imagine there's been emotes in the main chan 
I don't crash 
(ﾉ´ｰ`)ﾉ :D 
oh for the tweet 
lol 
yeah may as well just add a while True: try/except: pass and a break in the try so it keeps trying until it works 
pls update m8 
that doesnt look like a unicode error 
r8 8/8 
that happens if it finds that there's no key that matches that input 
like that expensivep ants one from last night 
that string only happened in one instance 
so it had nothing to continue it 
so it breaks 
if that makes sense. 
Also could be because I don't have a lot of things in the log 
how many lines? 
I'm not letting the one I have fire until it hits 100 but that's probably pushing it 
the main chan one on twitter works because there's so much 
200000+ lines 
yeah it just needs a lot more 
also how often does it tweet then? 
I wanna set it for 1hour 
so I guess change the hour to 1 and the other thingy to 1 
it's already set for 1 hour 
60 * 60 
o 
well i'm glad it works 
I just need to make it run on the server now lol 
let me seeeee 
:T 
rip? 
rap 
:< 
Man Erlang is nice 
5 line quicksort which is actually readable and makes sense 
This pleases my desires for academic wankery :D 
I looked at it 
looks messy to me 
Some of the syntax I'm not the biggest fan of 
But it's functional, so it'll obv. look a bit different 
>Well isn't that great? All that learning because there is no 'while' or 'for' in Erlang. Thank you very much I'm going back to programming my toaster in C! 
This tutorial is funny 
wait 
when did lissy become a mod 
x_x 
Err 
Since two-three days ago >.> 
This is old news lol 
I thought Mei-mei had gotten it or something lol 
rip me 
Why? 
Sorry to disappoint 
I feel like I may be in danger ;~; 
My tsun tsun jokes may come back to haunt me 
D-danger? 
lol 
Big deal lol

Hi wizzy! 
Just don't be Lib/Kiyiko and you're prob fine 
so the markov script finally fired in my group chat 
Link Title: Kuma Kai Ni sur Twitter : "uh huhh fsdafs okay the files being pulled test *Kuma Kai Ni" 
turns out it mostly read me testing it 
kinda funny 
naice 
Jesus FP is so damn efficient 
I thought it was a joke when they said it would be many times shorter than non declarative styles >.> 
declarative programming in general tends to be easier to reason about and much shorter than imperative styles 
Ye 
This is a really interesting way of doing stuff 
React and the modern databound generation of frameworks have finally brought it into browsers 
kuma's grown from a script to a whole package 
I'm so proud 
so something I learned tonight 
ctrl + c doesn't halt a python script 
er, ctrl + z does 
not 
so I found 200+ instances of python running on my server earlier when flask wouldnt bind to a port 
so that was fun 
lol 
nice JOB 
\o/ 
lol 
I just tried to leave a world of tanks match with ctrl + c 
lol 
nerd 
Sup 
I am waiting g for a co-worker to come to my store so we can open as one of my other co-workers failed to do so today 
lol 
packing the last stuff 
gonna take it there now 
Lol, ctrl +z suspends a proc 
It won't terminate it 
It's actually pretty neat 
hiii

gotta do a few chores first rip 
I just watched the cardinals get their ass handed to them 
right Luminarys ? 
You did? 
on tv 
I don't follow sports at all >.> 
sports are dumb Wizzie 
I almost went to the game today 
What bo1g said 
Soccer is best sport 
what is that bo1g 
No sport is best sport :D 
His telegram chat 
kuma's my telegram bot 
That he's using for kuma kai ni bot or whatever

it seems nice 
So vim for plebs :^) 
jk 
But I don't like things like this 
You don't really know what's goign on because you didn't set anything up yourself 
If you study it it's ok I guess 
I looked at it and it gave me everything I wanted tbh 
it's in a nice neat package 
Mhm 
Well whatever works for you 
you look down on me don't you （ ´_ゝ`） 
（ ´_ゝ`） <-- your face right now 
I always have dont worry 
literally a walking disappointment 
wow 
rip me 
huh 
No I don't mind what you do Wizzie 
As long as you don't use emacs :^)))) 
why no emacs 
isn't emacs an OS :^) 
Yea pmuch 
It's everything but the kernel 
Has full set of coreutils, web browser, and window manager 
Essentially 
these kind of conversations make me glad to be on windows 
Pleb :^) 
I can just be like ye I use VS Code and Chrome 
nah man 
I wake up 
do thing 
go to bed 
Don't we all? 
#happylife 
#botnetlife 
#justbotnetthings 
:^) 
well I did disable all that tracking stuff they had after install 
Again, whatever works for you 
Though it saddens me a little bit to see all the people who don't care at all about privacy, beacuse in the end they're the ones who screw everyone else over >.> 
yeah those 'nothing to hide' people are the worst meme 
I dont mean to sound like my grandpa but it's the principle of the matter 
I dunno though I did try and use arch as my main about a month or two ago and I couldn't get comfy with it so I reinstalled windows 
lol 
probably just got used to windows and little habits stick around 
I used Windows for a year and was pretty happy right off of the bat with Linux 
Except the lack of games 
SInce I still played a bit back then 
yeah, that too 
not something I kill over anymore 
These days everything I wanna play runs well in Wine, so I'm basically happy w/everything 
I dunno though I see it as like going from coke to pepsi or something 
I don't mind it but I prefer the prior 
which is funny cause I have a linux shell always open 
I just don't see my self using WIndows since I develop so much 
It's just too painful to do things in Windows compared to Linux/OSX 
hasn't been too terrible 
been having some issues with VS C++ 
It's def. worse on Windows 
that's about it 
I mean if it works for you, it works 
but Luminarys true game makers use windows :^)

she is true tsundere 
yea 
so it makes since~ 
truely 
truly* 
lol 
and I was an english major 
apparently I forget 
what a useless major 
yeah 
did you want to be a writer or something! 
no I just had the requirements so I signed a paper and got the cert 
luckily I got majors for technical theatre and multimedia alongside it 
I actually forgot my medals at graduation that was funny 
you got medals? 
wut 
yeah usually if you major you get a medal to wear when you get your diploma 
minors got pins 
neat 
I also had a competition medal I forgot to 
when I got statewide for web design 
nerd! 
ye 
best thing I have 
but that's neat

oAo 
so the who ebooks thing had to stop because it was leaking AB stuff? 
apparently it just "wasnt a good idea" 
lame 
because main chan is being made public 
in a way 
yeah 
do it from idc 
do what now 
so what did you mean by "clean" the logs 
it cleans commands people type and satsuki stuff 
entrances and exits 
I see 
you know when people type !luser etc 
mkay 
it will pick up if people say people's usernames ofc 
so I probably shouldn't give it my #HorribleSubs log 
well why not 
you want it? 
would they be mad if you did 
no 
HS is public 
thats what I thought 
I mean, you just have to change a couple of things to fit your logfile is all 
just as long as the cleanfile output just words and nothing else 
the only problem I may have 
is with announces 
also I need to make it compatible to older python versions （ ´_ゝ`） 
oh geez 
14:18:16<%Sadaharu> (auto-announce) [https://gin.sadaharu.eu] - [ 38M] - [Commie] Teekyuu - 58 [E2CFE073].mkv - /MSG Ginpachi-Sensei XDCC SEND 12802 
stuff like that 
Link Title: Oshiete Ginpachi-Sensei!! 
wizzie confirmed for old man 
no it's because my server is >3.2 
I wrote it for py3.4 
I just need to make it all 3.2 compatible 
and then bam 
shouldnt be that much different 
it could do it 
python3 is mostly the same 
it's getting an error on the encoding bit 
also in the case of that line, just really need to add (auto-announce) to WEECHAT list 
as long as it splits with tabs 
I barely even know how to weechat 
basically 
the logs split into tabs 
so [TIME]<TAB>[USER]<TAB>[MSG] 
bo1g: so [TIME]<TAB>[USER]<TAB>[MSG] 
Link Title: animebytes-ebooks/main.py at master · rekyuu/animebytes-ebooks · GitHub 
so on line 44 
>.> 
it checks to see if the user is a join or part or a user you want to ignore, as define in the WEECHAT list 
then if that all checks out it'll split the message to see if it's a link post or if the message starts with a word defined in the IGNORE list 
if THAT checks out, it adds the message to the clean file 
I added the except/pass to deal with unicode errors, so if it breaks it just goes to the next line. 
neat 
now this is how MY weechat log is set up, it COULD be different for yours. 
mine is basic 
also 
Link Title: cxg.de - Code Exchange 
that is the verbose output from my running it 
esy 
wat 
the last line looks like the kill line 
jesus 
idk what that shit is 
wizzie 
will you try just 
y-yes 
python 
the shell 
ok 
then import main 
I did.. 
idk what you want me to do......................... 
is it sitting there? 
it should have just started running 
I did python 
then import main 
is it accepting other commands or is it sitting there? 
did it print anything to console? 
it did nothing 
after I did that 
it just brought up another prompt 
not sure about this, but try removing the "if __name__ == '__main__':" line 
then try it 
ofc move everything after that back a tab 
fuckin debian 
lol 
it hates me 
did it do the same thing? 
mhm 
so that wasnt the problem 
put that line back and try running it as root? 
I'm starting to wonder if its a perms issue 
because it creates a file 
ahh 
could be 
or if your weechat logs arent set to be read for some reason 
while you're doing that I'm going to get rid of a few chores 
kk 
gah 
it doesn't want to work （ ´_ゝ`） 
ayy 
Luminarys: 
which keepass should I get 
keepass or keepassx? 
I use keepass 
It doesn't really matter though 
Make sure you get keefox and setup the plugin, that makes life very nice 
so I installed it from pacman 
but 
I guess I have to configure keefox to find it? 
Not really 
keefox is a plugin 
or should I just go with keepass instead of keepassx 
（ ´_ゝ`） 
Oh 
Ye, I dunno about keepassx 
As far as plugins go 
But it's probably fine 
Similar method I imagine 
bo1g: 
Jesus 
lol wut 
It's just weird 
it's an old movie m8 
ik 
I haven't eaten dinner 
I should but 
kitchen was just cleaned （ ´_ゝ`） 
>.> 
;^) 
how have you not finished that yet 
I went and cleaned out half of a ruined kitchen with a snow shovel, done the dishes, folded towels, watched an hour of a dark souls 2 run, ate lunch, not necessarily in that order, and you are STILL watching this film 
SAVAGE 
rekt 
thanks lumi 
pls bo1g 
I finished that a long time ago 
dont lie to me 
you just finished it now didn't you 
lol 
nope 
har har 
you watch it bo1g 
?? 
u watch it 
ill fite u 
faito 
weird 
trying to make this irc bot and it says it joined the channel 
but it hasnt 
owned 
so confused 
it says it joined the channel 
wonder where it is 
in ur butt 
har har 
:> 
feels nice being able to upload stuff without laging out instantly 
oh man I bet 
and download as much as you want 
it wouldnt have an issue connecting because I'm connected on the same machine would it 
or something stupid 
I dont get why it says it connects successfully but doesnt show up here 
guess I'll go find some irc package instead of doing it the hard socket way 
lol 
print out the raw socket? 
so you see if it just connect 
thats what it was doing 
it says it connects but nothing comes through 
so I assume it's not actually connecting 
this works with twitch's irc so I'm confused as to why it doesn't here lol 
this is silly 
I'm just going to run my twitch script and see if that works 
says it joined again 
not here 
so weird 
gonna print all the things 
:PPP 
I have to register the bot 
good god I'm dumb 
wat 
no you don't? 
oh 
you mean the irc register command 
yep 
still doing it 
lets see 
still says not registered 
lets me in here wtf 
what 
ofc it does 
you only need to identify with satsuki to join the official chans 
I guess I just dont understand irc 
not trying to 
just this one 
when I try doing it through sockets it just says I am not registered and sits there 
maybe you aren't waiting enough or something 
maybe 
I'll add a sleep and try that 
hahaha what 
it timed out 
wtf 
lol 
are you re plying to pong? 
it was 
think it just derped there 
oh you know what

keep getting disconnected? yea I luled rejoice Mert7 witcher going 
.markov #animebytes 
is a site I should watch its sequels and 
you should do what i told you to do 
randomly triggers on messages 
so it tries to "talk" to people 
I could 
it will be annoying as fuck 
but good 
that's what I do in my telegram chat 
has a 2% chance to trigger 
much easier to do it here, in Telegram it only triggers if it's a message and if it's not a command 
kinda acts like a tree and goes down until it finally hits the final one that's just a regex of '.' 
bo1g, you should 
make a "markov buffer" 
so it always generates at least 10 lines 
then it wouldnt be any "downtime" 
the only wait time it usually has is creating the clean output logs 
which only happens once the bot initially starts up 
I could 
but it's just like a second because the AB one is 20000 lines long 
or more I forget 
.markov #animebytes 
high reduction in price to news articles I've read you 
meh that wouldn't be hard 
also should add an .addop option for the autoop 
feeling lazy is all 
spent all morning tearing down walls and shoveling debris again 
kinda want to die 
You need to use a real DB bo1g

Does that not work >.> 
.say :D 
.ping 
Pong! 
Oh, just alot of lag 
Oh right, i have self ignore built in 
I SHOULD use a DB 
Just use SQLite 
but I could also just write a dictionary to json and be done with it 
Simple and portable 
I should though 
I never sat down and learned to database 
I did a simple thing with node about a month ago
